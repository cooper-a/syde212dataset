jenzam,Living in the Philippines is prolly one of the worst things to happen in my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/jenzam/living_in_the_philippines_is_prolly_one_of_the/,DripKoffee531,2,2020-10-20 11:54,"I mean sure, good scenery, good food, ""good"" people, rich culture but it's def being rebooted, but the worst really is having the longest lockdowns in the world due to poor leadership. This lead me to less going outside, less hanging out with my friends (whom I haven't seen since January), and less meeting new people.

Anyway, I'm up for any conversations right now but will probably reply late due to poor internet connection and my 20kg dog decided to sit on my lap while I type this.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jenzam/living_in_the_philippines_is_prolly_one_of_the/,:chat: Just Chatting,58.66
j32hn4,Music “phases” you had during your teen years,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j32hn4/music_phases_you_had_during_your_teen_years/,roxiedoxiedog,4,2020-10-01 5:21,"So I noticed that music is a pretty important thing for a lot people in their teens because it’s something you can relate to. What different “phases” of favourite music did you go through at that time?

My answer is kinda embarrassing but...

When I was 13-14, I only listened to Avril Lavigne,

But when I was 14-15, I stopped listening to Avril and went onto stuff like Green Day and My Chemical Romance

When I was 16 and the first few months of being 17, I was into indie rock and garage rock. Pretty much because every girl I knew was in love with Finn Wolfhard (one of the kid actors in Stranger Things) and he was in a band, so I listened to it and enjoyed it (but now I realize how much that band sucked). So I succumbed to the “indie kid” thing and tried to be cool by spending the year listening  to mainly the bands Finn posted on his Instagram stories, like Mac Demarco, Twin Peaks, and Snail Mail. But now I realize I only enjoyed those bands because I thought I’d be a cool indie kid lmao.

  
Now  at the later half of being 17, I realized how dumb it was to mainly only listen to the music that I thought made you cool, and found stuff that I actually like myself. I’ve recently found out how much good alt rock music there was in the 90’s and I’ve been liking that a lot recently, like the Pixies and people like that. Also never liked rap before but now it’s grown on me",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j32hn4/music_phases_you_had_during_your_teen_years/,:note: Music,69.55

I left for college in June, right as my girl best friend who is 2 years younger than me left to move to a different state. We’ve both visited home but never at the same time and today we were able to visit the same weekend and I got to hug her. She’s my baby, I took her under my wing my senior year in a sports class and we’ve been inseparable every since. 

My guy best friend, who is my person and there for me through my worst, worked today but the instant he got off work he came over to hug me and eat dinner with my family. Being in his arms again was the most indescribable feeling of coming home. He has been my best friend for going on three years and I don’t know what I would do without him. He has come over at 1 in the morning before to bring me a drink from my favorite coffee stand and play uno with my family just because I was sad.

Currently live in California while all my family and friends live in Ireland. I haven't seen them since January, and due to restrictions with my Visa + Covid I literally have no idea when I'll next be able to see any of them.

Throughout quarantine I've felt very emotionally dull; like not sad or negative, just dull, not really any intense emotions until today.

My mom texted me yesterday and said that her and my sister are preparing a Christmas basket to send to me, so that although I'll be separated from the family, I can still get gifts and feel their love from far away.

Reading those words just made me break down. I started crying intensely, wishing I were home and not so far away from everyone I love. Honestly it felt so good to cry though, I had been suppressing all of my feelings about home for so long because I knew that it wouldn't change my situation, but crying just allowed me to feel.... something, again.

It's currently 12:17 AM, I've been 21 for 17 mins, I have an interview and an exam tomorrow so I'll be pretty preoccupied throughout the day and won't really have time to take calls from family before they go to sleep due to the time difference, but it's all ok. 

I'm grateful to have been emotional for a change, and as my mom says, every day is a day closer to me coming home.

I swear I’ve ever felt lonely though. I love being in my own quiet. Not having to talk and blabber about nothing. Just chill after work, no commitments. I can’t disappoint anyone if I have no one type thing. 

At work I’d socialize but most of the time I’m working you know. I can handle short talks during breaks or lunch. Lol. 



This pandemic hit and I haven’t worked in a while. I didn’t have friends as it was but now I realize that I don’t even have anyone to text or talk to. I wake up knowing I have nothing to do. No one to talk to. No where to go.

I’m closer to 30 every day and I don’t know what a relationship is. Commitment. Intimacy. That “lovey dovey bullshit” that I always ram from.

I'm somewhat of a weird person in the sense that I'm albino, but I've always managed to to navigate the issue and find a group of people I'm comfortable with and vice versa. That pattern hasn't held up since I moved.

Over the last couple years it's been generally fine. I focused on work, on myself, went on a few dates, and have generally embraced my introverted facet. Just this week however, I had a birthday. I found myself doing things I didn't want to do just so I wasn't relegated to enjoying a beer by myself for the 26th big one. That weekend I ended up at someone else's birthday party and witnessed what I wanted for myself. Suddenly I felt out of my depth - the ground under my feet was no longer firm. I was on the outskirts of someone else's community.

Resisting the urge to feel sorry for myself I decided to try to plant some roots and ended up getting another date - or so I thought. She was very sarcastic the whole conversation, so when I said ""7pm it is,"" to which she replied ""I'll try to fit you into my busy schedule {smily face heart emoji},"" I thought I had a sarcastic yes. One Uber ride later I texted her and said ""I'm at the bar, my phone will likely die.""

I pick up the phone to a ""you're funny... you're joking right?"" Apparently, that ""sarcasm"" was meant to be taken literally. She had not agreed to go on a date at 7pm. Phone dies, half hour later I text her and told her I thought she was just being cute, to which I get a ""no I was being serious."" I was kind of hoping she'd extend an olive branch since I just embarrassed myself so hard. Or perhaps just a ""sorry I should have been more clear."" I received neither.

Overall, big misunderstanding on my part (although, if I take her response literally, I'm not sure that's a great look for her). Lot of embarrassment as the cherry on top of a Birthday Loneliness sundae. Overall I feel like an observer of life, not a participant. I'm just not very sure how to become a part of something bigger than myself.

But, for some odd reason I feel good and bad at the same time. I'm glad I feel something, I think. After a couple years of professional advancement and social stagnation I guess it feels good to rock the boat.

It's happened with me before as I lost classmates, friends after Primary and Highschool. But, this is different - whole college life, the whole study life, the almost no worries life is going to end! 
Don't get me wrong that I'm scared of what's about to come. I sure am excited and I work hard in everything I work for. I have done exceptionally well in my internships. 

But, Maaaan... College is a beautiful and probably the most rememberable phase of someone's life and it's about to end!

So when I found out my freinds are going for a trip this weekend I signed up. I told myself that I’m going to be super chill and don’t even think about work and school.

In car, like 5 minutes before reaching home I got a canvas notification that assignment is created. I check it and see that I have a geology lab DUE TONIGHT. Instantly every good feeling that i had from the trip was gone. 

I didn’t say goodbye to my friends, I didn’t say hello to my family, I didn’t change my cloths full of sand, I just sat behind computer and typed away since i only had less than 2 hours to complete it.

I knew we only have labs Monday but professor never publishes the lab until after lecture so I thought this might be one of those special labs that we have to do before class and somehow I forgot about it.

But this lab was so hard, it didn’t make sense. How can our professor expect us to finish this without even having a lecture about the topic?
I decided to ask my classmates and they told me that after 10 minutes professor emailed us that it’s due tomorrow. I didn’t see the email because I was freaking out at the moment.

Anyway, I saved what little I did and got ready for bed. But I’m still stressed even though I shouldn’t be and can’t sleep.

Having four legs as opposed to two was significantly better. Bipedalism is very inferior in terms of comfort. I felt so much more balanced and sure footed. My hooves felt sturdier and more powerful than the best pair of steel toed boots. Standing upright was not a chore but a natural position, perfectly comfortable, ready, prepared for anything. And I was so very tall, towering above everything with my wide stance on my four impressive legs.

And the *speed*!! I was running through a town and I was faster than cars — not because I could run unreasonably fast, but because I didn’t have to wait for cars in front of me. I was running uphill through a forest and I could navigate rocky terrain with ease. It was hardly an effort. I was impeded by nothing. I was unstoppable.

I got out of a relationship about 2 years ago and even though I tried dating here and there I can not remember the last time I felt this way.

I got off the subway with her, a few stops before mine mind you, with the intention of asking her out. However a lot of people got off at the same stop and I chickened out in the last second because of how many people were there.
I just walked the rest of the way home and I have not been able to get this girl and every detail about her out of my head since.

For one, I hate myself that I did not talk to her.

I guess there are millions of such things around and I do like them.

But then again, I feel a complete looser for sending a meaningful letter to some stranger on the internet or spending time to find the right book that a person would love, instead of sending a meaningful letter to one in my close family or sending *them* a book instead of sending it to a complete stranger.

I guess deep down the road I am searching for meaningful friendships but deep down I know that finding those friendships on the internet or with random people on the world is not the way to do it. It's likely not going to work out. Getting a ton of meaningful letters by others who don't even know your name or actually give a sh\*it about you is not what ""real"" friends are...

I was the type of kid that had one very close friend and maybe one or two other people I was on talking terms with. It was like that all through out elementary and middle school. My sophomore year of high school I was finally diagnosed with severe anxiety as well as social anxiety. 

My parents often accused me of “fake it” because I don’t have a fear of being on stage or public speaking. Even though I’ve always tried to explain to them that this isn’t the same as talking to a few people or one on one. That is far more... intimate? For lack of a better word. At least it is in my mind, but due to them and my general dread of talking to people I didn’t make very many friends in high school or afterwards. 

I recently moved away from my parents and started a new job as a leasing consultant. I was terrified at first, because I thought I was under qualified. But my first few days have been wonderful and I’m really enjoying it so far! Today my property manager was on a video chat with the manager of another property and introduced me to them. They were very nice and the three of us ended up having an hour long conversation about books! I was an avid reader as a child that just got back into reading within the last few years. As it turns out the manager of the other property was the exact same. At the end of the call the other manager said I was a great hire because I am “very intelligent and have great conversational skills”. They even invited my manager and I out to lunch tomorrow to continue the conversation! 

It just made me smile from ear to ear the rest of the day!

We bonded pretty much for life because of gaming. When we were younger, we spent all nighters at gaming cafes (because we didnt have PCs) playing League. 

As time went on, we branched out and added a few more people in our group and played other games, too. I helped him build his first pc also.

Since the pandemic, get-togethers have been impossible so we mostly hang out on discord. Usually I play games with this other friend, multiplayer games that kind of stuff but he doesnt get to play since he cant buy the games. I usually end up buying it for him.

j8ym0p,How conversations evolved with technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j8ym0p/how_conversations_evolved_with_technology/,root993,4,2020-10-11 4:01,"Back in the day when the only way to communicate with someone was to talk to them face to face, conversations were completely synchronous. You ask someone a question or make an observation and they respond with an answer or another observation that builds on top of yours. 

When we upped our technology game with the invention of the telephone, the same behaviour was propagated. When text messaging was created, even though we had the ability to communicate asynchronously, we still chose to send each other one text message at a time and wait for their reply before sending the next one.

# The need for conversation threading

With email, there was a clear need to segregate conversations into threads and each thread would be identified with a subject. 

This helped with maintaining sanity in one's mailbox and made asynchronous communication a lot easier. You could look at an email days after it was sent and just by looking at the subject a context would immediately be established. 

Email clients further make conversation threading easier with the help of quoted text. When you reply to an email you can click on those 3 dots to expand the entire thread and get a quick overview of who all participated in the thread, what did each of them reply with and where exactly are we in the conversation.

# Rise of instant messaging apps

When WhatsApp came into existence, I was under the impression that it was a better alternative to text messaging. But when was the last time any of us used whatsapp to send a single text message and wait till the other person responds before sending the next message? 

When we use WhatsApp or any other instant messaging apps, we send a whole flood of messages one after the other before the poor soul on the other end even has a chance to reply to the first message. 

These apps now needed a way to allow conversation threading and they usually solve this problem by giving you the ability to reply to a particular message.

This is a good way to add threading to conversations but it can get messy pretty fast especially if you try to use any of these apps for work conversations where there are loads of stuff to discuss and each message could be a thread in itself. 

This brings me to the logical conclusion for managing conversations - Slack. 

# Instant messaging with controlled chaos

Instant messaging is not something we can avoid anymore whether we're dealing with formal conversations or informal conversations. Informal conversations can be mostly handled using apps like WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook messenger but this will not fly with formal work related conversations.

For work related stuff a single interface where you can message one person at a time and keep track of the threads by replying to particular messages will no longer work. Sure we can organize it a bit better using groups but if you have a team of more than 2 people this is a sure shot way to descend into chaos.

Slack solves this problem by giving you the ability to create channels where each channel is meant for having a particular type of conversation and within each channel any message that you send can become a separate thread when people reply to that message.

# Closing notes

There are a few other mediums like facebook posts, comments, twitter threads etc that I have not discussed deeply, but the underlying concept in all of these mediums is the same. 

Folks need to say something either to another person or a group of persons. Somebody can then take the conversation further by picking up a single nugget of information from the OPs post and expanding it further.

so im out with some people. i think we were leaving a restaurant or smth, it wasnt really clear where we were lol. we were all masked up cuz the rona and all. so i go to hop in the car with my best friend. once we get in the car, my mask lanyard breaks, and i guess it took my mask with it? cuz i didnt have a mask anymore after that. and my friend's mask broke too.

so next thing you know, my friend and i are out of the car and walking thru the park. we cross a couple streets and end up at the metrorail station (like an above-ground subway) and the rail is about to pull up. we realized we cant get on without a mask, so i told my friend i would go back to the car and grab more masks.

so i started making my way back to the car, and i was picking up the beads that were on the ground so i could remake my mask lanyard. so im runnin with my handful of beads, and i guess i got lost? either that or i was tryna take a shortcut or smth, and i ended up in this house, asking for help with my mask lanyard. i see this elderly woman sitting in a chair and i go up to her. she calls me by my name, like in a  ""is it really you?"" kinda fashion. she looks up at me and she has these golden yellow eyes, like the kinda eyes you see on mystical beings in tv shows and stuff.

i ask her about putting my mask lanyard back together, and she tells me i cant (dont remember why). i tried to tell her i already have the beads for it, but she tells me that they wont work and i have to start over from the beginning. so i start pleading for her to not send me back, but she does her slow, mystical handwave, and i get teleported back to the beginning of my dream.

and i was like ""nuh-uh im not doin this again"" so i woke myself up lolol the end

Have you ever experience where you thought about someone or remembered him/her and search for that person and then you saw a recent post about something life changing/huge event for that person?
For example, while I was looking at posts of people in social media there was this picture of an engage couple and the girl looks like my friend. Normally, I would just keep it to myself and laugh ( I dont constantly communicate with my friends) but I have this urge to send this pic so I did. So after an hour or so, she replied so we catch up on how are things are going. So I looked at her profile and it turns out its her birthday (Sorry Im really bad at remembering birthdays). I was shocked coz we haven't communicated for a while and i dont really remember her birthday but then was given an opportunity to greet her.

Another instance, If I thought about an artist I suddenly remember then will check them out on how its going. Then will see that news for example that they just came back from a hiatus or after a few days there would be a huge news about that artist.

It doesnt really happen a lot. Maybe once a month. But last year was the year I realize it and thats were a lot of it occurred compared to this year. There are more examples but I already forgotten about it.

All the general things such as HIPPA acknowledgments, financial and billing info, etc. I get to the questionnaire regarding why I am there, and what I to see in my new dentist. 

These were really simple questions; who was my last dentist, any surgeries, when was my last cleaning, yadda yadda. The question regarding my last cleaning stuck out like a sore thumb because I really didn’t know when my last cleaning was. Was it in mid 2018 or 2019? Not sure. I continued to fill it out. 

I finished up my paperwork, and let the receptionist know that I completed everything. She let me know that I was all set, and that someone would be out shortly to take me back. I sat in the far corner of the office staring at the wall. Suddenly, my mind began to race with lots of thoughts, but not in the overwhelming way that this usually happens. 

Suddenly, I was overcome with emotion and my eyes began to well up because I realized how well I am actually doing. After 10+ months of my most recent episode of depression, I realized that I am hopeful for my future for the first time in forever. 

My mood was on the better side of satisfactory when I woke. I realized that I didn’t gag at the sight of the person that I saw in the mirror this morning. And I haven’t  told myself that I should die or fucking kill myself since I don’t know when. I care more about who I am, and who I am going to be tomorrow, and this realization was surreal to me. 

I never actively tried to harm myself, but I did neglect my health and well-being not caring about whether or not I was here tomorrow. 

All I’ve ever asked for is to be happy with who I am. Now, it isn’t too far away. It is/will be work in progress, but I am prepared for that journey. My battle with depression is not over, but for today, depression has not won. 

TL;DR: On the other side of my latest depressive episode, I realized today that I happy to be here.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jfouo1/today_was_sobering_for_me/,:story: Life Stories,71.55

I talked to him multiple times a day, tried to understand everything as thoroughly as possible, and made multiple review sheets. For concepts that the prof did not teach super well, I went out and found resources to better teach me.  

On the day before the test, after like 3 of my questions, the prof said ""I can see you're studying very hard. I wish more students did that. They are probably not scared enough for this test..."" and I shrugged the compliment off in his office, but it was something that made me proud. Then, the test came, and I did super well! :)

It was my 25th birthday on the 9th, I was super excited and threw a socially-distanced barbeque. It was great until one of my ""best friends"" showed up drunk as hell, and started acting weird around everyone I invited including my new girlfriend (that day also marked 2 months of us being together).

My friend started hogging the barbeque, drunkenly swaying from side to side while standing over it, other people noticed and tried to get her away from the grill because they didn't want her to get hurt. I tried ignoring her constant attitude because I wanted to make sure everyone ate and had a good time and I didn't want to let her ruin my mood. A few hours later and my girlfriend tells me that my friend left in drunken tears, saying I was being a ""birthday-zilla"" when I really don't know where that came from at all. She just made everyone including me feel super uncomfortable, I even tried offering to get her a Lyft home and got her cups of water earlier in the day to sober her up but she refused them.

For whatever reason she decided to come back to the party after having a cry somewhere, tried pressuring me to take shots with her and when I refused she accused ME of being the weird one. From that point on I totally left her alone and hung out with other people. My other friends started coming up to me asking what was wrong with her and why she was being rude to them, it was all really embarrassing. THEN, as if it couldn't get any more uncomfortable, my other ""friend"" (who also showed up already drunk) decided to stand up for me and confront her about how much of a dick she was being, and the two of them ended the night with almost getting in a fist fight. A great day was totally ruined by their drunkenness. It was a really important day to me not only because it was my 25th birthday but also because I was excited for my girlfriend to meet the people I hang out with. Them being drunken idiots and almost physically fighting is the impression that will be left with her now. I honestly don't even know how to respond to their half assed apologies or if I want to respond at all.

I'm just deeply embarrassed even though I know I personally didn't do anything wrong, and wish I could go back in time and not have the damn barbeque at all or just not invite them.

j4el1u,Feeling guilty about old relationship..,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4el1u/feeling_guilty_about_old_relationship/,Ok_Philosopher_9842,2,2020-10-03 12:00,"Backstory: i was in a relationship with someone for about 4 years, lets call him Jake. We dated throughout high school and during the entire relationship we would fight on and off, but during the last year it got unbearable to the point where we broke up several times

During this time i started working and doing projects and it was the first time that i really started doing something independent or unrelated to my relationship. During this time i met Matt and we became good friends. Matt would flirt with me sometimes but was completely respectful when he realised i wasn’t single. I hate to admit it, but spending time with Matt felt like a breath of fresh air, with the alternative being me constantly fighting with Jake. 

During one of our fights, Jake ended up breaking up with me (for the tenth time) and i ended up suggesting that we take a break instead, and decide if we want to work it out after it. During this break however, i felt more free than i ever have. This was because of Matt maybe, and was definitely also because of the project i was working on made me feel like i was good enough, and that i had a life outside of my relationship. Before this, i always felt i was dependant on Jake and i couldn’t function without him.

Anyway, then when Jake messaged me asking to get back together, i refused. And i left him. Alot of drama ensued where he begged me to stay but i was adamant to leave and felt like this is something i desperately needed for myself. 

Mind you, Jake is an amazing person. He’s a genuinely good human being, but we just didnt see eye to eye on so many things and then would always fight. The good times were great, but very rare. To this day i believe any girl would be lucky to have him, he’s great.

So a few months after i ended things with Jake, Matt and i started dating. And it’s amazing. It’s almost been a year, and i’m so fucking happy and that man gives me so many butterflies.

The problem is: every now and then, i get this bout of guilt and heartache, that i hurt Jake. I made the decision for myself and because i was tired of us fighting, but i keep feeling guilty and sad whenever i think about how i left him. No, i don’t miss my relationship with him. I simply wish i dealt with things differently i guess? He was shattered when i left, and im sure he was hurt when he saw me with Matt. And at that point i felt i was doing what was right for me. But now i feel guilty and sad and heavy when i think about how all of it hurt Jake. 

I did message Jake and i apologised to him around 6 months after our breakup, where i apologised for the way i hurt him and he did forgive me and said there was no ill feelings.

Why do i still feel this way? Why do i feel hurt and heartache looking back at all of this? Specially when im with an absolute gem of a person now who i love with all my heart...

The second (for when I’m feeling less into work) is a secluded mountain house overlooking mountains filled with nothing but falls trees and drinking some nice coffee that my partner made. Here we’ve got nothing but time to look at the beauty of nature or go exploring in it.

Jurassic Park
A near-perfect action/adventure movie with an amazing score and groundbreaking special effects that still hold up to this day. Scary and exciting yet breaktaking and heartwarming at the same time. If you’ve never seen it, you’re doing yourself a disservice.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park
A frustrating sequel that, while impressive on a technical level with top-tier dinosaur action and even bigger special effects, is soiled by a weak storyline with some of the dumbest main characters in any action movie ever. If you like dinosaurs as much as I do, this one is at least worth a watch.

Jurassic Park III
I hate this movie. It takes everything that made the first movie great and takes a fat dump all over it. A once great action/adventure movie is now a slasher/thriller that is only kind of scary at times and looks like hot garbage visually due to lack of budget and practical effects being reduced in favor of cheapened CGI. If you like this movie, we can’t be friends.

Jurassic World
Much like Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens, this pandering soft-reboot delivers on feel rather than substance. It’s a film that relies on callbacks and “‘memberberries” instead of building an interesting story with compelling characters. While this movie does make an honest effort, only die hard Jurassic Park fans will find it remotely exciting.

Not just on reddit, but in some of the groups in in on Facebook as well. 

I've recently joined a group on Facebook that's all about shaming bad tattoos. Like, actual bad tattoos from people who have little to no experience. But half the tattoos people post in there are actually good, they just don't like them. The comments are usually quick to call them out, but I haven't seen the admins doing anything about it. Maybe that's just because I'm new. There's another Facebook group in the same vein for posting good tattoos that you just don't like for whatever reason, and I think a decent chunk of what gets posted on that group would be better off in the other tattoo group.

Reddit is the same. So many subreddits have a no crossposting rule, and yet I've seen the same thing crossposted dozens of times in the same sub. There was recently a spike of this in r/arethestraightsok and every other post for about a week was people talking about a story where a gender reveal party caused a huge wildfire. Like, we get it.

Had this pandemic just made people not give a shit anymore? Am I looking into this too much?

And while I'm usually excited and grateful for my birthday, this year is a bit different.

The past few days I haven't been too excited about my birthday or looking forward to doing anything special. 

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety since I my first year in high school. It was manageable between the years, but I started to notice it getting worse at the start of 2019. I got more depressed and anxious.

I feel 2020 has pushed my mental health over the edge. My mental health has plummeted. 

I've been developing an ""I don't care"" anymore type of attitude and that applies to my birthday as well as all the things I loved. I don't get excited or happy about anything anymore, even things that make me happy. I haven't worked out in 3 years.

As this reckless idiot accelerates, a small child with candied delirium in his eyes skips and hops towards the door with parents in tow, they're all happy af! yay! singing all... the..way... and time literally stands still. In my minds eye I'm seeing this kid getting bonked hard. Am I fucking YELL, ""STOP!!"" very loudly. I think I yelled 'HEY!' but it was very loud.

And the dude driving slams to a halt and looks at me, full-on wide eyed. The kid's dad in that split second has grabbed his kid and looked up at me. The old lady, the middle aged white dude in long white sleeves and a nice tie, the further away people getting gas ALL look at me. Shit is tense for a second.

I again forcefully reiterate at the guy ""Slow the fuck down, man! There are fucking kids walking here!"" He's still looking at me doe-eyed, I point to the kid and he doesn't break eye contact with me. Things got weird in that split second for everyone and IDGAF. I look up to the stopped crowd and they all just keep doing their thing after that shocking audio and I get in my truck and leave.

It was upsetting to have to yell violently at someone in a public setting but it was necessary and I don't regret it.

My high school coaches will be there, but after my freshman season I don’t really want to play anymore. The environment and personality of the coaches puts so much pressure on me and I absolutely dread it.

This is what brings me to my main point. My dad simply wants to believe I’ll enjoy it and I enjoy playing high school basketball. I feel like he just denies it whenever I try to explain how I feel. Not just in basketball but in all sorts of aspects of life. I feel like he’s too engaged in certain ways. I’m happy to have a dad who cares about me, but I wish he would stop putting words and feelings in my mouth 

I’m not sure what to do. Sometimes I just want to yell at him and tell him it’s my turn talk now and he needs to listen. I don’t understand why he’s so persistent with saying I enjoy things I don’t. He is a former college basketball player, which is probably a big part of that, but still. It’s getting under my skin and I want to take control and tell him I can make decisions for myself.

Over the last few weeks I was dating someone who then wanted to be friends. Funnily enough, I was starting to like the guy because when we started talking I noticed my life was improving. I was waking up earlier, getting my work done being productive. Admittedly, I started talking to him when my mental health was also good. Then after a few weeks as is usual my mental health started going downward. I noticed that even being around him, I felt that because of my downward spiral and he chose to be friends. I actually wasn't okay with this but why choice did I have? Friends is better than nothing. (When we stopped talking I felt my mental health spiral further downward. I was over texting him. Glad I wasn't blocked.) 

So what did I learn? I shouldn't rely on others for my own happiness. 

Another thing I learned: sometimes getting away for a few days to a new environment can also vastly improve your (or well my mental health). 

Now that I spent a weekend with some friends I feel like I can get through the week. Taking things one step at a time.

(Got laid off in March however :(.) At the restaurant, the tips are split with the kitchen staff. (7% divided between cooks/dishwashers.) Usually I would make around $5 in tips, $10 on a good night. 

Last Valentine’s Day we had a new hire in. He was supposed to be helping me with the dishes since it was extra busy. I’m a fairly small woman so on a normal shift it would take me some extra time to get everything put away on the higher shelves, so I was looking forward to having a bigger guy to cut down on that time. He was completely useless though. Complained the whole time, washed like 2 plates total, kept draining the sink every time I turned my back. By the end of the shift I was livid. He “quit” and left early, and the chef had to stay an extra hour to help me finish all the dishes. 

We keep our tip cups behind the bar. When everything was finally done, I went to go collect mine while one of the waitresses was vacuuming. I noticed my tip cup had been stacked inside the new guy’s. (They’re clear so it looked like his name was on mine.) He had about $10 in his, mine only had a few coins since he had been there all day and I had only started during the dinner shift. 

I knew he had quit and wasn’t coming back, so he probably didn’t even know he would get tips. His money had been put into my cup accidentally, so if I took it people would think it was an honest mistake. I needed the money because college, and I really considered taking it.

I ended up separating the cups and asking the waitress what money belonged in which. She re counted it and put a little over $10 in his, and about $2.50 in mine. She gave me a kind of odd look when she handed me my money.

My next shift I found out she had told my coworkers about it. She thought it was weird that I had genuinely cared enough to make sure it was the right amount after he had pissed me off so much. She said she would have just taken it. 

I think back to that sometimes and it makes me realize that maybe I’m not such a bad person after all. He probably needed that $10 just as much as I did.

We are all very sensitive and scared to come out of our shell and be educated again. One kid in particular caught my eye. For one, he's *extremely* cute. Like; tall, dark hair/eyes, covered in moles and freckles, well proportioned, slim...literally gorgeous (very feminine, lol.) He has the most wonderfully intelligent voice, and he's brilliant with numbers, and very knowledgeable and somewhat interested in a few things similar to me (anime/manga, animals, science, geography, etc.)

I'm still trying to figure out whether I like him romantically, which is quite tough for me, and I have a lot of trouble interpreting romantic feelings towards other people...I'm doing my best. For now at least, I'm just doing my best to work him out of his shell.

I've been at it for just under four weeks now (about a month) and here's roughly progress:

&gt;I've been making lunch/sweets for him every Friday. The first week it was bread/sandwiches, then the next it was pie...this week I made him cheesecake and he seemed to love it!

&gt;We've been talking over text, and he's been getting progressively more and more social. He's now began speaking on my public discord server with as many as four people at once, which is a massive step from not even being able to speak with one!

&gt;He now talks on *voice chat*. He's gone from barely a few words or sentences as a response, to speaking loudly, clearly, and even initiating or *interrupting* conversation, which is huge!

&gt;He gets very flustered when I call him ""hun"" (a pet name I use for most of my friends, don't worry) or compliment him (""pretty"", ""cute"", or just generally going ""aww"" at the majority of things that he does...I'm quite flirty.)

&gt;He will now take hugs! Which is HUGE as he is very afraid of physical contact, and though it makes him very embarrassed will still very willingly accept.

&gt;He even *cracks jokes*, which I've now discovered as he is a walking pun-factory, and is a massive goof and total clutz. He's genuinely the sweetest and most innocent guy I know and I love him to bits as a friend at the very least.

&gt;The last two nights specifically, he has stayed up until about 4am (6am was tonight...rip my sleep) to play video-games and talk. We rarely talk about real life, and more rather the game we're in at the time, but I dont think I mind so much for now - it's still huge progress!

Given how I'm the only person that's really been talking to him over the past few weeks, I feel partially responsible for getting him to come out of his shell...he's gone from quiet, reserved, and even nonverbal, to warm and humorous in just a few weeks! When it's just the two of us, he feels so comfortable, though when more people join the conversation he tends to retreat back into his previous state.

I think given all of this, at the very least he likes me as a friend, let alone romantically...I'm still trying to figure out the latter, but after all, it's only been a month! I have an awful lot more time until we start to get to the point of discussing any romantic involvement. :^)

I'm quite self-conscious to share this with friends after a comment that one of them made on my excitement towards my positive influence on his social-life...so I appreciate all who read this and find it somewhat sweet!",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4u03b/extremely_shyunsocial_and_introverted_guy_m15_at/,:chat: Just Chatting,57.03

I never cared about birthdays. But I want to do ""something"" for my 18th birthday because It's been a terrible year for me. And also 18 is the age where you unlock literally everything in my country. So It kinda matters.

I don't have a lot of friends. And I only have a few close ones. I don't want to throw a huge party because It's risky for people's health. A small gathering of 5-6 is people is fine for me. Here are some options I have:

A) One of my close friends' (let's call him Bill) birthday is just the day before mine. I was thinking of a ""Shared Birthday"" on the weekend after our bithdays. Because we share a lot of common friends. But if I do that, I won't have a special birthday for me. So I'm not sure about this option. 

B) I could invite all my close friends, including Bill, to a simple birthday in a park. And I could attend Bill's own birthday. 

C) I could invite my close AND non-close friends into a crowded party. I don't want this one at all. And It's really hard to pull off since I'm not very confident. But It's an option.

D) I could let my best buddy plan everything. He is not very good at it.

E) I could buy all the alcoholic drinks I want and get hammered alone, since It's gonna be legal. This would be my last choice.

I was expecting to move back to New Zealand but unfortunately COVID-19 hit Korea like a truck and soon came the travel bans. 

I was absolutely destroyed by the news but I decided to stay positive and just skip my year 12 learning( because I knew I can just do year 13 learning in 2021). 

Its nearly the end of the year and New Zealand has decided to keep the travel restrictions until mid 2021 which means I'm mostlikely to also miss out on my year 13 learning. So basically I'd still be in highschool while my close friends leave to college.I'm actually so devastated right now and I feel so empty... I was stoked to go back and see my friends. 

I guess the thing I'm mostly worried about is that without my close friends being with me It'll be the same as what it was when I first moved to new zealand.. I struggled to fit in and felt so alone in a foreign country. 

Another shitty thing is that I also fail to fit in here because my Korean is really poor and I dont have much opportunity to make friends. So I will be just staying here friend-less 
waiting for the day to return. 

I just need some advice or some encouragement right now because for the past 2 days I've been just sitting in my room and watching YouTube to distract my self from this shit..",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jkwbgo/im_actually_so_stuck_and_scared_for_my_future/,:story: Life Stories,73.1
j4gep4,I made a game!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4gep4/i_made_a_game/,TemporalFuzz,18,2020-10-03 14:59,"Making a game has been a dream of mine for a few years now. I started taking coding courses at a pretty young age and I almost instantly knew that making a game was something that I wanted to do. I ended up taking computer science classes in high school and doing more independent study and coding became a passion of mine. At this point, I knew that I had the skill to make a game, but self-motivation has never been my strong suit. I ended up coding lots of smaller projects along the way, but focusing on one project for long enough to get it to this point was extremely difficult. I had many game ideas that I invested time in but gave up on. However, quarantine gave me a massive amount of free time, and I eventually decided to make another attempt. It wasn't easy, and I almost gave up a couple times. At one point I had to replace the entire framework the game was built on which brought on a slew of headaches. Unfortunately this change ended up breaking the server because of the hosting service that I was using, so I had to switch hosting services, too. However, after about month of work, I have a very solid framework for the game, and release is in sight. Better yet, I'm not feeling the lack of motivation that has stopped me so many times. The gameplay isn't super complicated or polished yet, but I'm still incredibly happy that I proved to myself that I can do this, and I have many ideas for improvements!",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4gep4/i_made_a_game/,:ididit: Made did it,67.49

In grade eight, we had a field trip to a mall for a math project. We were supposed to make math problems based on things like sales (what percent is the discount) and deals. One of the rules we had was we had to ask before taking any pictures of products/price tags, and if they said no, we had to go somewhere else. One group of five or so boys went into a store called La Senza, which is a lingerie store. They found a pair of handcuffs in the store and the handcuffed one of them to a display in the store and they were fooling around and taking pictures. An employee walked over to them and told them they couldn’t do that and the boys bolted...except for the guy that was handcuffed. They got in trouble after that.

I’ve been working since I was 16 and saved up to buy a car, I’ve got a 2008 Peugeot 107 which is my greatest achievement, cost me £2000. I decided to put all my focus onto uni so I quit my job, I’m really good at budgeting and I have a budgeting plan for my student loan which will last me 12 months, until the next year starts and my student loan resets.

But my car just keeps breaking down. I need it to travel to and from uni, and already I’ve had problems with the break pads, emissions control system, and today is the second time my exhaust has fallen off (this time due to rust). I’ve only had my car a year and a half and this isn’t even everything wrong with it!

The thing is, I could definitely afford a new car, I have some savings and could have money from selling my car for the down payment. In fact I have £200 a month to spare after insurance and petrol expenses. But because I’m a student, there’s no way I can buy a car on finance, and it sucks. I honestly sometimes wish I could get free money, so I can buy a good car that’ll last me for years and years. 

I guess being able to buy my first car outright was really lucky. I wish the car had no problems. But I have 3 years of university and I honestly can’t see my little car making it.

It’s not my first choice, but it’s a small school that piqued my interest, and would be a really great escape for someone who’s spent almost their entire life in the city. It’s the first college to have accepted me, and they did it within a week. It’s not super often I’m proud of myself, but this is one of them. I’m able to take off quite a few schools from my application list as well, having the backup of a a school allowing me to have a real chance at going is a really great thing for me right now. I’ve been super scared that colleges would see my grades or test scores and see them as bad, despite having above average in both. I’m definitely a person who desires perfection, so I see above average as not enough. I try to push myself, but I always end up giving up.

The first time, she asked me to open my mask for verification. Man, I’ll open anything for her 😅😅 

The next exam with her, I genuinely found myself constantly look for her. The last time, I felt my heart when she asked me at the gate, ‘Economics or Maths?’ 

The sad thing is, I don’t even know her name. Her ID was around the zone, where a guy simply cannot stare. Even sadder, I’m probably never gonna see her again. 

In an alternate universe, we make out and make some passionate love. But in this reality, it’s just sadness 

Probably her Asian parents will get her married to some douche. But deep inside, I just wish she succeeds in life. She finds her perfect man. She accomplishes her life goals

And I genuinely want to meet her again. No, I won’t ask her out (25f probably isn’t right with 18m). But a coffee together to get her know more is something I’ll never reject

All quotes are verbatim; it just happened and is kinda seared in my brain.

I should probably preface this by saying that I have extreme anxiety and am terrified of people being mad at me, and tend to deal with stressful situations by agreeing with whatever people are saying until I can easily get out without looking like I'm trying to escape.  Additionally, I am a (quite small) woman, so incidences of street harassment etc just get swallowed or even responded to with a smile, even if I'm scared or upset.  I have a hard time even recognizing when I'm being harassed, and usually assume that any uncomfortable situation is somehow my fault.

Today I was walking one of my dogs in a park, and I was staying quite far away from people because of, you know, the whole pandemic thing that's killing people.  About halfway through the park, I had to walk over to a garbage can to throw out a dog bag, and got within about 15 feet of an older man sitting on a bench.  He called out and asked if my dog wanted to say hi to him.

My dog is very friendly and loves meeting people, and this is a type of positive social interaction that does not focus on me, so usually I would say ""of course!""  However, because of the whole pandemic thing, I apologized and said ""she's very friendly, but I'm social distancing and not getting close to people right now because of the pandemic.""  He mumbled something that I couldn't hear, so I apologized that my hearing isn't great and asked him to repeat what he said.  (You may have noticed a pattern of apologizing here!)

He responded, ""You talk too much.""

I was taken aback, and just said ""what?""  Then I swallowed, and several seconds later surprised myself by saying ""That's very rude.""  I've never said anything like that before to a stranger.  He said something else, and again, I apologized for not being able to hear him, and he motioned for me to come closer.  I said ""I'm sorry, there's a plague on, I can't come any closer.""

He then said, ""What, you don't like men?""

I froze for several seconds and didn't know what to do, but then I gathered my courage and said ""I'm fine with men, but there's a pandemic happening, and also this conversation is making me uncomfortable so I'm going to leave.""

And I left!  I just walked off!

Logically I know I should have done so much sooner, and that I shouldn't have felt like I owed him conversation or an explanation or anything, but I've never been able to do so before.

That was the closest I've come to standing up for myself or saying what I was thinking when someone wasn't being good to me, which to me feels very much like being rude and is terrifying but I did it anyway, and I'm both super proud and super nervous and I just wanted to share with somebody.

TL;DR:  I told someone that they were making me uncomfortable and walked away!  I have really bad anxiety, and today a stranger asked to pet my dog, and when I apologized and said no because I'm social distancing, he said ""you talk too much"" and ""what, you don't like men?""  I managed to get the courage to say ""I'm uncomfortable with this conversation and am going to leave,"" and then I did!",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jexmgc/today_was_the_first_time_in_my_life_i_had_the/,NaN,64.95

I’ve been staying in my family’s village house for the pandemic but I normally live in a small apartment, and I already have two adult cats (who are currently with us in this house, of course), so there was no way I could keep the kitty. We spent a lot of time and effort trying to find a home for this cat, and yesterday I finally convinced my cousin to take her for a trial period (most likely turning permanent). I was to bring the cat to her on Friday but this morning she messaged me asking if she could come and take her today due to schedule issues. I wasn’t ready to let go, but I agreed.

Now she’s gone and I have cried my eyes out in the past hours. I know it’s silly, since we’ve only had for two weeks, and I know she’s going to a loving home, but I can’t stop thinking of all the cuddles I won’t have anymore, and how just this morning she was carelessly sleeping on my chest.

I'm 21 and University,  foreign language lessons, workouts and trying to not lose touch with people are pretty much the things I use most of my time for. Im working only during summer vacations because that's when work won't get in the way of my University classes and studying.

So I’ve been thinking of what to say to my tattoo artist at the consultation if he asks me why I’d like a tattoo in an area that would affect job prospects, and the answer is as simple as this. Non conformity. it would force me to be extra motivated as well as putting me in a position where I’ve no choice but to explore my creative side and find my creative passion and earning an income from that, and honestly that has always appealed to me so much. What’s the alternative really? Get a boring bullshit 9-5 office job where at the end of the day I’d come home to a frozen meal dinner? I can’t do anything fulfilling like starting a family, my genes are trash. My wife would be giving birth and then out plops my baby in a wheel chair and knitted green quilt. And then I’d just be in this fucked cycle of existential dread where I’m used to the routine of coming home from my office job and interacting with my weird child and eating frozen meal dinners until my 40th or 50th birthday where I finally decide to sit in my garage in the car with the windows rolled up blasting Metallica or Coldplay while I inhale exhaust fumes. What kinda life is that? And not to mention the fact that my wife would probably be fucking the mailman the entire damn time. I just don’t really see any downsides to this really, I’d have beautiful and meaningful artwork on my skin, I’d get to truly express myself and I’d get to turn my passion, once I found out what that is into a fulfilling source of income. the thought of following societal norms for the sole sake of fitting in makes my skin crawl, what is the point of life if you’re not living the sort of life you want to live?

Even when you look at just the calories, sugary sweets and candy are so packed with calories that I never really noticed how much they could effect someone's weight.

So, I ususally don't have to be the one to make sure my sister goes to sleep. She has a really bad sleep schedule like me, and goes to bed at 5am-4am(she's homeschooled rn due to covid)

Well, my parents fell asleep early due to being drunk as heck so I had to take care of my sister and make sure she goes to sleep etc. First I read her a bed time story, but while it was really fun, she still couldn't sleep. So I crafted a plan.

I made a bet with her. If she pretended to be sleeping without falling asleep for 1 hour, I'd give her 5 bucks. I'd check in 1 hour later to see if she was still awake. She was obviously very excited about getting easy money, and obviously agreed to it. She fell asleep in 15 minutes.

This made me think about tomorrow and realized how sad she would be about not getting the 5 bucks. So tomorrow I will tell her this: ""Aw, well I can make it a little easier for you, if we do the same game but 1 hour earlier than last night."" That way she won't give up on getting that 5 bucks, while I can easily fix her sleep schedule.

I'm honestly feeling like such a great big brother right now :,) I'll eventually give her the 5 euros and tell her what my plan was all along.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4s290/my_plan_to_fix_my_8_year_old_sisters_sleep/,:story: Life Stories,86.94

I didn't really know where to post this. Here we go.

Background: I (29f) live with my friend (30f) and I have a puppy of 3,5 months. Every night, we take him for a 30 min walk not far from our place. We live in the city center and always avoid dark alleys and walk wherever there is light and other people at sight. We also take the same path every single night.

Yesterday, we went out as usual. And as we sometimes do, we stopped on a bench at the end of a small riverside park and sat down facing the street. That's the first time I saw him. I have no idea why, but this guy gave me the creeps.

He turned left, then went into the park. I kept an eye on him just in case, but didn't really think much of it.
A few seconds later, a couple stops and starts talking to us about our puppy and how they want to get one. My friend keeps talking to them and to my surprise, I see the same guy again, coming from the same direction and turning left again at the end of my bench. Now I start to think how strange it is to see the same person twice in a few minutes, like the scene is repeating itself.

Anyway, the couple leaves, we start walking to head home, still on a very busy street. At this moment, I am on high alert.
We cross the street and by chance we met 5 elderly people with their dogs and started a conversation in front of a small hall that serves as an entrance to a pub. The same freaking guy comes again, this time from behind as if he was following us, went to the pub's door, did not go inside, came back and kept walking forward.

Now he is ahead of us and we are walking behind him. At the end of the road, normally we turn right, and go through a dark small garden, maybe 4m×4m. We saw him go that way and as I started freaking out, I ask my friend to go straight instead of right and then told her :""if we see that guy a few meters ahead, then it is very strange, because it does not make sense to go right and make a big turn and come back to the other side. Nobody does that, why take the much longer way?""

And the thought came to us that maybe he knew in advance that we were heading that way.

She started being alert also, and the further we walked the less we saw him. We didn't see him. Now we had to go through a long corridor with shops and at the end of it cross the street.

We crossed that street running as the puppy is not well trained and keeps laying down in the middle of the road. 2 guys started talking to us an playing with the puppy. As we turned back, we saw the same guy, AGAIN, waiting for the green light to cross the street.
He then went another way, then came back again one last time. We were for 10min standing with those 2 guys while they were playing with the puppy. He saw us walk away with those guys and didn't pursue us. At that moment we were close to our home and still managed to drive a rental there.

Today we are going again for a walk at the same time.
Should we change our route? Are we freaking out for nothing?
If we see him again, what should we do?
I really don't know what to do and had a hard time sleeping last night.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j5exty/run_into_the_same_stranger_5_times_in_a_couple_of/,:thinking: Thoughts &amp; Ideas,88.77

This is essentially a talk about what I want for myself moving forward and I would like suggestions and support in any way. 

A year ago I decided that I didn’t want the corporate lifestyle. I’m still in College but I decided that I wanted to live a life of no regrets. 

All my life 2 things have always stood out to me as things I will never get tired of and they are Music and Gaming. 

I’ve loved music for such a long time but it took me till I became 16 to figure it out. I loved music when I was so young as well to the extent that when I had a PlayStation Portable (PSP) I would go to game soundtracks that I liked and listen to them with headphones as I slept (This was way before I knew how to download music) I loved it so much I decided to start making music, from making beats, writing lyrics , learning how to produce and learning to make song art. I taught myself everything with the help of YouTube. 
My name is Yung Suxge on all music platforms if you’re wondering. Music has always been there for me and it’s something I want to do for the rest of my life. It’s fun, emotionally comforting and it makes me feel at peace. 

As for gaming,
I’ve loved this for as long as I could remember. I started watching Youtubers and they give me inspiration to make my own gaming videos So I started a YouTube channel but what really pushed me was watching other people be successful I started taking gaming seriously When I saw a YouTuber grow his channel when I had been following and supporting him and it really gave me courage to begin mine. So I did, It’s called “Yung Suxge Gaming”. 

The fact that people actually pursued what they wanted and accomplished it is what keeps me going. I just want to make my dream a reality as well but honestly it gets tough.

Myself &amp; fiancé have been together for 5 years and he’s a great person, however he has such an odd little trait. I was wondering if this is a common thing for people to do? 

When he knows people (strangers) are watching him/ the dog/ or within earshot he starts to ‘act’ up for them. As in, if he is training the dog and there is someone else there he will get a bit louder, praise heavier and occasionally glance in the strangers direction.
We took pooch in to a pet store that has a self run doggy tub to give him a bath and a couple stopped by and asked if they could watch just to see how it works. Sure no problem. Then fiancé started kind of talking to the machine really loudly and almost narrating what he was doing to himself but clearly doing it because he was being watched. The couple quickly left and I jokingly told him to stop being odd and talking to the machine. 

Is this a common thing for people to do? Do any of you do it? What do you do it for? Thanks!",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jj8u46/is_it_normal_to_play_up_for_strangers/,:question: Questions,79.3

They are genuinely some of the nicest, most supportive people I know.

People say that about their family all the time, but i really think it. 

Parents have always supported me, I could come out as any kind of sexuality and they wouldn't be upset. 
I have arguments with them very rarely, and they are generally pretty tame compared to other stories I hear.

My sister always looks out for me. Whenever anything happened in school, she'd be the first to call me over to sit with her and her friends and look after me. I can imagine it was embarrassing for her, but she didn't care.

My little brother is a saint in his own right. We say little kids are ""sociopaths"", and don't emotionally mature until they're older. Well, he's the exception. 

When I was pretty ill recently, he would do a load of little things to look after me. Make me cups of tea, make sure I had tissues, and was feeling warm enough. I got him a few things to say thanks afterwards.

What does he do? He takes me out for food to thank me for that.

I never grew up around healthy relationships. Between my parents’ failed marriage and my sister going through toxic relationships, I had a messed up idea of what love was. At one point I was in a long-term relationship but we broke up as we fell out of love. All in all, I just started to believe love wasn’t real and any semblance of it would fade eventually.

A couple years ago I made a friend. Our friend group was very affectionate and would say stuff like “ily” a lot, but never used the word love. Instead we’d say “I heart you” to each other.

At some point this one friend and I started skyping occasionally which over the course of a year turned into 24/7 calls. He became one of my best friends and we even kept our calls on while we slept.

According to him, in my sleep I would mumble “I heart you” to him. It felt weird to me knowing I could care about someone so much subconsciously.

Eventually, we started dating. He made me feel safe and we founded an amazing relationship based off trust and communication. We were very vocal about boundaries and very careful of respecting each other’s. He knew about my past issues and didn’t say anything about love until I did.

At some point I realized I love him. He makes me feel happy and safe and calm and understood and respected. Now instead of “I heart you,” in my sleep I tell him “I love you.” Knowing that I can safely feel love again after I thought it wasn’t real for so long is such an amazing feeling.

But when it comes to love, it's like I don't have that built-in system inside my body or brain, or my radar has been broken for centuries that can to make me to realize : okay that's love. but don't give me wrong, I know who I love or what I love, I just can't tell the moment of the feeling being loved, like in my intire life might lest than 10 fingers time that I can tell : okay that's call being loved....maybe? or feeling loved, and that usually, mostly came from one of my little puppy, she loves me, she will just walk around me and give me a kiss then walk away.

j38s9l,How do you live a caged life?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j38s9l/how_do_you_live_a_caged_life/,viobro,2,2020-10-01 13:42,"I'm a 17 year old kid. My life has been very 'restricted', with many privileges missing that many other kids in australia generally do get. Just picture me as that one friend who couldn't go anywhere or do anything, and you most likely never understood why it was like that.

As well as living a childhood without many privileges such as being able to go to birthday parties, get a toy here and there from the shops, go out with friends, visit and see paces outside my house, make memories, I won't get much freedom at all later in life. I have extreme pressure from my abusive father who wants me to be a doctor, although I want to be a teacher. After that phase, I will eventually get an arranged marriage. I will raise a family with a woman I don't love. What's the reason to live without being able to choose my own path in life.

It may seem like I'm being naive but there's many details about my life I could go into to put this into better perspective, such as physical abuse and my family nearly breaking up essentially this one time. I basically live in a great country but my family situation is what makes it difficult.

I don't know what to do. I literally can't be a doctor because there's nothing more I dread and I will not pass any courses at uni for it. I do not want to raise a family with a stranger and devote my life savings to them (because i'll be the sole income earner in that situation). My childhood has been so underwhelming compared to my peers and I don't want my future to be like that. Whatever options I've thought of, there's always other parameters that make me lose something else.

At this point, I'm not motivated to perform so well in school. I got predicted to finish in the 97th percentile in my final year of school based on my latest results but I've already decided to start prioritising less study to enjoy my life as much as I can, whilst I still can. I've switched subjects u to do more fun ones, I'm not gonna try as hard in school because what the fuck is this 97 number gonna do for me. I'm afraid I will lose my friends after school due to caged nature of my life where I can't go out or do anything. Our discord messages will just gather dust till they don't remember me. 

My school holidays will quickly come to an end and then I'll have to go to school again and commence in stressful studies once again, even if I'm not trying as hard. Then my final year will hit and of course that'll be worst of all. Uni will follow and that will be the point where I can either gain many opportunities due to being an adult that freely go to campus to do work but really actually maybe goof of with friends for the first time ever. That, or my life goes to absolute shit from my father's pressure on the correct career path to take.

May sound like a rant now but at least there's some context now. So, what can I do? Or what did you do if you were in a similar situation?",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j38s9l/how_do_you_live_a_caged_life/,:question: Questions,75.84

When I watched Interestellar  like 5 years ago my mind got blown away and made me think deeper about this whole thing.

One of the main aspects that amazed me was gravity.

For those who didn't watch the movie, there is a scene where two Crewmates decide to land in a planet to see if it is capable of holding life in it.

However, because of gravity (don't remember if the gravity from the planet or the black hole near it), one hour there would be like 7 years in earth.


This made me think for a long time the question: **What is Time?**


The official answer is that it's a concept made by us to measure when something happens,  but what is it exactly? And why does it get affected by gravity? 

Is time another dimension we cannot see but it's there?

Is it a thing we touch without knowing and that we cannot modify like gravity?

I’d have a nice little moped, too. No car. I’m sick of cars. I’d have a dog. 
I’d go to work, join a gym. Maybe join a club or two! I’d love a book club!

Every morning I would go for a run around a nearby park and back, totalling around 1.6 km, followed by crunches and pushups at home. Then a few weeks ago a nearby gym opened back up so I then adjusted myself to run 1 km to the gym, workout 1 hour, then run 1 km back home on weekdays, and then run around 1.7-1.8km on weekends without the workout, all while including the pushups/crunches at home - today is the 19th time I went to the gym since it reopened.

Idk if I've lost significant weight or gain significant muscle but I definitely feel alot better! I can also feel minor improvements such as not panting and running out of breath while running anymore, and being able to do more pushups/crunches in one go.

Whenever I need to find a show to throw on on the background though, I noticed recently that I (M 26) have usually resorted to throwing on cartoons that some would usually say are for younger audiences. I watched Gravity Falls back in April, and I’m working my way through Adventure Time for the first time ever. I was a bit self conscious about this and wondered why it was I was doing this instead of watching something closer to my age range, but I may have pinned it down.
I had an emotionally abusive stepdad growing up. Pretty rough stuff, I won’t go into it, but starting in 5th grade, my grades took a turn towards failing. His solution was to ground me from electronics until they came back up. They never did because I just never felt the positive motivation to do so, so this led to me being grounded from electronics for the entirety of my school career onward from 5th grade, with the exception of summer vacations and my senior year of high school. Aside from the odd Harry Potter or superhero movie a grandparent would sneak me out to, I was essentially in the dark about pretty much anything pop culture related that people my age would have been into at the time, books and music excluded. I would hear every so often about certain movies, or TV shows, and just feel so left out, not being able to join in on the conversation. Even today, as an improv comedian, it’s jarring when my fellow performers bring up a reference from their childhood, and I just have to guess around it, because I simply have no frame of reference for what they’re talking about. 
It’s weird having the realization that I’ve got a gap in my mind of pop culture knowledge that I may never be able to fill. I had a bit of embarrassment for a while being a grown man watching cartoons meant for a target audience of children, but realizing I’m trying to fill in the gaps makes me feel so much better about it. It certainly leaves me with a lot more to watch this year, I’m probably going to look into either Dragonball Z or Batman: The Animated Series after I finish Adventure Time.

TL;DR: I was grounded from electronic media for the majority of my childhood, and I’m now trying to catch up on the stuff I missed out on.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j46jgh/i_think_im_trying_to_catch_up_on_the_childhood_of/,:chat: Just Chatting,59.67

I stepped on the scale and saw my weight was 395 pounds. I was 5 pounds away from 400 pounds. I was in shock, I didn't know I got to that point. I had been an obese child and now I was a obese teen. I had a thyroid problem in the second grade which caused me to balloon up within 6 months. Kids teased me all through elementary school. In high school I started being a class clown with still getting good grades and started having friends. I wasn't happy though and in the inside I was terribly depressed. After the day at the doctors I decided to make a change in my life. The doctor said I would not live a long life if I stayed at that weight. So when first thing I went to the grocery store to buy ingredients for the Atkins diet. With exercise I started out with walking, then progressed to other forms of exercise. I fell in love with jogging, hiking, weight lifting, aerobics, kickboxing, and yoga. In 8 months I lost 100 pounds and graduated high school. People were amazed by the progress I made. By 21 I had lost 270 pounds and felt way better, but had excess skin. I ended up getting skin surgery for the excess skin that was hanging off my body. I was finally happy because my health was way better. I went off every blood pressure medication I was on. I felt so much healthier. I was proud of myself for acheiving this goal. It makes me determined for my big career goal I'm working for this year in my life. That's why I'm telling my past because no one knew about except my family and hometown friends.

I remember struggling with a math concept and he goes ""oh you're an alternative learner"" he explained it in a different way and drew a picture and I picked it up on the spot. He proceeded to do that with essentially my entire math curriculum because I told him it was where I struggled most.

So six months ago, I was a 17 year old 5'11 210 lbs guy. I am very cool and friendly by nature and nerdy indeed.I was aware about my overweight and weak body and knew what it would take to call myself a fit person. So I decided to wait until next year, when I would finish school and join college to do it.

I am the type of guy who very rarely  gets angry at anyone. But once you are on my bad list , I take revenge, in a lot more humiliating way.

So it all started 6 months ago ,when this corona situation was taking heat, about 2 weeks before the lockdown.

My parents saw this Covid situation rising and decided to move to our village, until things get normal. So did my Uncle 'Ray' with his son 'Shit' and their whole family.

So when they came in the village, they decided to pay my family a visit. When they saw me, Ray and Shit started insulting me for being fat and looking ugly. I can take jokes, but it was a straight insult. They stayed for an hour and there was literally not a single minute they didn't insulted me. I, every time ignored them and laughed, didn't take it that seriously.

 Now here comes the interesting part. For the next two weeks , until this mandatory lockdown happened, Ray, whenever he was meeting anyone in the whole goddamn village, he literally would mention me, my 'fat and ugly body' and would insult me again .It became so fucking worse that whenever I, my dad or my mum would step out of our my house, people mockingly would ask about my overweight body. His son shit, whenever we meet, anywhere, would insult me by calling shitty names like 'fatfuck' (the least worse) every single time, infront of everyone.

I was never this much self conscious and had so much self hate in my whole fucking life. I was literally having thoughts a brain scarred person would have.

*BUT*

I never replied to their insults.

Because I wanted to give them much more pain, insult and trumas than they gave me.

So I waited.

Waited for the right time.

So firstly, I decided to drop my BMI from 32 to 22. And just the next day, lockdown happened.

I started waking up at 4 every single day, did an hour of cardio in the morning, and 2 hours of strength exercises (covering whole upper and lower body) every single day. Started eating an overall very low calorie but healthy diet. So my schedule would be a 3 hour physical exercises every day , 5-6 hours of sleep and for the rest day, I would study.I literally many times cried waking up in the morning because every single part of my body would be in pain so much. But in the end, I would leave the bed. And whenever I felt like eating a pizza or a pie my mum made for us, a memory would come why I started this all and I would stop eating. So I didn't have any cheat day until 6th of October, the day I turned 18.

So I achieved it. I lost a total of 60 lbs, dropped my bMI from 32 to 20.9. Became a guy who can only run 400 meters to finishing a half marathon at 6 minutes per km average pace. A person who can't do 5 proper form pushups to doing 120 pushups in one go.

So yesterday, after roughly 6 months, Ray once again decided to pay us a visit with his family. The second he and his son saw me, their faces became pale. So a guy who wouldn't stop insulting me now was avoiding me for the whole time lol. Only it was Ray' s wife who commented that I have become a very fit person now. 

It all became much more interesting as 'shit' have become obese and Ray is over weight. So now I started it. I at first, in front of everyone, politely asked Shit's weight, he said 'I don't know man maybe I'm 160-70 lbs, not sure, haven't measured in a while (I was laughing as hell inside as he was clearly over 200 pounds). So I immediately pulled out the weighing machine and asked him to measure it. Now everyone one in the room was silent. Now Shit started acting shitty and started making excuses like 'I don't want to or I don't need to measure it' etc. My dad already knew what was happening so he also pushed him a bit to do it. So he finally did it. He was 221!!!!!.

I literally started laughing. Just imaging a 5'8 221 guy who is a douchebag by attitude. You have shit.

Now, I started calling him every single name he was calling me 6 months ago in a lot more humiliating and demeaning manner. He started crying. I was still laughing and calling him names.

Now his dad entered the conversation to defend his 'cutiepie'. I started insulting him to for his small height (5'6), ugly fat body and ugly face. I insulted him a lot too , by saying things like ' a person can't tell any difference between a torned up pumpkin and you from 10 meters you little man' in very insulting way.My dad and sis were enjoying the show silently. Then my mum stepped in and started scolding me for talking to an adult like that.

Now a Broken Ray and crying Shit left our home.

I was never this Happy before. I had my revenge.

Next day, my dad asked me to go on a ride with him . After driving for about 15 minutes silently, he parked the car. Now I was expecting a good long leacture BUT..

He said' I know you son, I know your heart very well. You are one of the kindest person I have ever known in my life. So now whatever others say for what you did yesterday, for me, you did what they deserved. I am proud of you son. Then he jockingly said just don't pull something like that again will ya! 

Then we ate burgers at a fast food store and headed home.

I wanted to move up to AP Bio from Hon Chem this year because I was bored in class. I reviewed the curriculums for this course and noticed I've learned everything, so I gave the school my curriculums again and asked them to review them again so I could move.

And those [censored] science administrator said I can't move up because I didn't learn everything even tho I CLEARLY said to them that I did. So now I'm stuck in a class where I've learned everything.

I [F16] have been having a rough time lately (haven’t we all?). I’ve been struggling with panic attacks, what might be depression, I don’t eat properly and I don’t sleep well. This has made it hard for me to keep up with school, and I’ve been talking to a trust person there. As a fist step she advised me to see if I could get fewer hours at my work. I work part time at a McDonalds. So I decided to talk to my boss. 
I have three bosses, and the one I went to has seen me get a panic attack, and so I feel like he would be the first to talk to. I like him a lot, and I feel like I can talk to him. I really trust the guy. He said he would talk to my other boss, and said that he would always be there if I needed to talk, or would like him to ‘give a message’. My other boss then called me in to talk, and I explained the situation. We was really understanding and said that I of course was the first priority, and work came second. He didn’t like that fact, that one of his best employees (his words, not mine), wouldn’t be able to work as much, but he understood. Then my third boss, called me about hours, asking how many I would like a week, and if there were anything she could do to help. All three of them were so sweet, and understanding that it made me feel relieved. 
I’m sorry this became such a long post, but I just wanted to share, that there are still good guys out there. I feel like I have the best job in the world, with the best bosses and it’s only part time. I feel kind of weird not working as much, I miss it, and suddenly I have a lot of spare time.

Yesterday we spent like 5 hours together. We walked around and talked, we played the piano in my University dining hall, then we watched a couple of movies together on her laptop.

I've recently realized I needed to be more confident with women and being willing to man up and do something that shows that I'm interested. So, when we were watching movies I sat close enough so that we were touching, and when I was comfortable I braced my hand in a spot behind her so we were basically leaning into each other. When the movie hit the more scary parts she would lean in and grab my hand, so afterwards I would end up with my arm around her waist. By then end of the movie-watching we were laying back and cuddling with her head on my shoulder or chest.

The reason I'm writing all this out is because I've been interested in this girl for at least a year now and I had previously never had the balls to make a move, *and she probably liked me this whole frickin time.* 

I'm such an idiot, I genuinely could not tell if she liked me before that. We hang out every couple of weeks, I think we're both just coincidentally the type of people to not want to make a move because we don't want to make things awkward and we're both pretty good at not staring at each other. In high school I was once asked if I was asexual, and I've heard her friends joke before that she's asexual, so obviously one of us had to act a little out of our comfort zones if anything was gunna happen.

I used to just psych myself out trying to interpret things so that maybe I would just know somehow if she was interested but that never got me anywhere obviously. I can't believe I was so worried about it. I'm honestly still psyching myself out. Like, ""what if it was just a platonic 5 hour hang out + cuddling session."" Come on dude.

In conclusion, I'm happy that this girl I've been interested for so long is interested, and I should've just made a move months ago lol.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jhys7v/i_am_so_dumb_with_women/,NaN,72.6

On the one hand of course not!

On the other hand, those things happen, but now other people have to live and exist there, a city isn't a mausoleum and we I imagine it's hard to get people coming into your wonderful town when the mention of its name makes you're stomach flip. Also wouldn't it in a way be disrespectful for the event that happened? I mean by continue to live and exist there slowly the meaning of the name is going to change, and in time no one is gonna think of those places in that way, think of the  Paris massacre in 1961 more than 300 killed,but it's not the first thing you think about when you hear Paris, because there's so much more other information available about that place, and the more famous a place is the more you're gonna hear about it and the association to it will change in your mind quickly, so wouldn't the right thing to do would be to freeze the event in time? Change the name of the place will guarantee that it will be remembered longer (or you know giving it a more unique and distinctive name but it's not what we're talking about here).

So what do you think? I honestly don't have an opinion yet, it's an interesting and important little thing to think of, thought it could be nice idea to discuss",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4x3yx/changing_the_names_of_places_atrocities_occurred/,:thinking: Thoughts &amp; Ideas,61.13

So my girlfriend recently moved houses to Oceanside in Long Island. A few days ago I drove to her house for the first time and Oceanside doesn’t have many main roads. Most of the roads are local and there’s like 1 highway.

Anyway while driving there I fucked up and took a wrong turn. The GPS has to find some other road for me to get back on track and it made me drive down and take a turn on this really weird street. 

To the left of me while I was driving was just trees, a huge ass amount of trees and they all looked beautiful cause of Autumn. I was honestly thinking to myself “damn this place is mad nice” and then I looked to the right and noticed something super weird.

On the right was a street of houses but they all were abandoned. I mean a whole street of houses. Some were boarded up and most looked run down. There was not a single car in the driveway or on that street.

I was driving down that street and it was long as hell but as I kept going down it was the same thing, trees on my left and abandoned houses on my right. 

I finally had to take a turn and got back to a main road and got to my girlfriends house. I didn’t think much of what I saw at the time but thinking back now I’m like that’s pretty fucking weird.

Anyone know what that was all about? Why would there just be a bunch of abandoned houses?",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j9ani0/i_think_found_an_abandoned_neighborhood/,NaN,89.18

Here’s the catch, I am not always able to wear a mask. I for the most part don’t do any unnecessary trips to avoid potentially harming people and when I do leave, i try to go during times where shops might be emptier. Weekday morning etc. I also have a Hidden Disability mask exemption card.

While the staff were lovely, and i went to a big bookstore because there would be more space to stay distant. I felt awkward. I saw the looks people would give me, one guy muttered close to me that I was faking it. I felt awful but I understand. You see an early 20’s, slim woman walking around and it’s normal to question. 

This morning wasn’t great and on my way back, I generally sat and thought, why wouldn’t anyone want to wear a mask. I want to wear a mask. It’s not worth the hassle and it can’t be nice having the world (to an extent, rightfully) telling you, you’re wrong. 

To think there are people who go to places without a mask like it’s a sport.

So people that are way into your adult life, how do you feel, and do you compare it at some point with your pre adult life?

I liked talking to her tho she sometimes doesn't seem interested in talking to me. She rarely texts first and it's always me who bother her. For sake of an experiment I stopped texting her and it broke my heart that she didn't text me. But after like 15 days I recieved her text and she said, ""Why don't we talk like before"", later we had a nice conversation and I felt bad for doing the no text experiment. She said she was waiting for me to text first and thought that I am no longer interested in talking to her. I felt bad and apologized.

Now on the same day, we exchanged a few pics and she saw pink blanket in one of my pic. She laughed and asked if I'm gay and ofcourse it infuriated me. But I knew she's just kidding so I replied No with laughing emojis. After that I asked her whether she likes boys or girls. She said both and she sent me a picture of her local actress and that got me curious. I went on and asked if she's straight or bi and she answered ""straight"". It was confusing for me coz she said she likes both a moment before and I told her that if she likes both girls and boys it means she's bi.  I said this so politely because I was not sure if she really meant it when she said she likes both.

Now she didn't reply to this and left me on seen and I felt guilty. I apologized again with a long text and she didn't reply to this either. Next day I asked her what's wrong and I asked for the reason why she started acting weird all of a sudden. Then this is what she replied, ""YOU'RE DISGUSTING, YOU WERE DISGUSTING LAST NIGHT""

It broke my heart and I felt like crying. I was called disgusting for only asking if someone's straight or not. Even when I didn't bring the topic to table in the first place. She was the one who called me gay for having a pink blanket ( also, At that time I was not in MY room )

I don't know if I should continue talking to her or not, also she doesn't seem interested in talking to me now.

j4rhm1,I had no option other than jumping out of terrace this morning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4rhm1/i_had_no_option_other_than_jumping_out_of_terrace/,SunsCat,4,2020-10-04 2:25,"So this morning I woke up a little early just to make a pee. And to make a pee everybody has to go down the stairs and walk for few seconds because my bathroom is far away from my room.

As soon as I left my room, I saw a money , yes just ""one monkey"". He was quite far away from where I was standing so there was no problem going down the stairs even then I was already sacred about what if it came right at me , you know how monkeys are , unpredictable beasts.

So I went to bathroom thinking that there was only one monkey. I went ,did what I had to do and was about to return to my place. 
I was looking for the monkey that I had seen moments ago , he was right there where I had seen him minutes ago. So the path was cleared off the ""danger"".

So I began walking upstairs as soon as I turn myself I saw two Giant Monkeys . Idk whether they were insanely that huge or they seem huge because I was viewing them from so near. However there is pretty wide terrace and I was standing at the middle of it and those two monkeys were around the entrance of my room. 

Idk if they were coming towards me or not but I saw no option rather than jumping out of the terrace . So my reflex made me run towards the edge and I made a quick jump thinking that the monkeys were coming at me. 

Luckily for me the floor was not cemented. As soon as I landed I rushed towards the bathroom ,got in there and locked my self.

After 10-15 minutes I went out side the bathroom and was looking for the monkeys. There were none however I saw a stick decided to use as a weapon. 
Finally I made my way to my room . But I am still feeling the pain after the jump especially on the neck region .

My biggest takeaway from today incident is that what if the venue was different and it was a five storey building , would I jump then?
 Not knowing how much of danger I was in I made a mistake but had no option . The moment I saw the monkey I should have made sure that I carried a stick with me.
There lies a fine line in being prepared and preparing for the next danger once after you face it.

I am shocked...because i never knew women thought about me this way!

I never celebrated any of my birthdays, neither of my parents celebrated theirs too so they just didn't think much of it. I was mostly a lonely kid growing up so I didn't have any friends, so no one threw me a birthday party. I also never went to a birthday party except once when I was very young.

Every birthday for me is just a normal day. Not this time though, I decided to spoil my self a little, I went to the nearby mall and had my first Burger King meal (I regret it lol), since fast food is the most I can afford.

I am not upset, I am happy, and it's mainly because I can stop lying about my age when signing up. That's basically all that I am thankful for lol. If you can't guess already I turned 18 today. 

I am not sure where to share it. So hopefully this is the right place. I just wanna say thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday, that's the best thing I can hope for.

So, I'm switching up my schedule and this was my first day on the new one. Plus side, my progress wasn't exactly lost during that time - I was able to pick back up where I left off and inch forward a bit, I just could've been a little farther along by now if I hadn't stopped. Well, c'est la vie. I've been trying to get a steady, consistent gym schedule going anyway for the last couple years (I never really went or worked out before then), and I think I can really get it this time so long as gyms stay open (working out at home isn't for me, tried it, no real room or good setup) and I keep going.

And I finally got over myself enough to do something I've wanted to incorporate into my workouts: Dancing! I'm not trained or some prodigy or anything... it probably looks spastic as hell to the people watching (especially since they can't hear what I'm listening to), but it was fun all the same. I was dancing in front of one of those large mirrors to get a sense of my full body movement. I was going for a hip-hop style, could only do one song (Read My Lips by Ciara, for the curious), but I might go a little more often to just dance between workout days.

And I actually dance at work a lot, I generally don't mind if my coworkers get a kick out of it (and they seem to, though I don't know their actual opinions on my dance skills vs the entertainment value of it... I am kind of curious, but afraid to ask). But for some reason, I got self-conscious at the idea of total strangers I'd barely (if ever) talk to seeing me dance at the gym, vs. people I see and work with and talk to frequently. Ah well. I'm pushing myself to get past my social anxiety to varying degrees. I've long since gotten past my fear of singing in public, and speaking in public, so dancing is the logical next step.

I find myself essentially or virtually “tagging along” with her to turn the tv down and listen in on others or stare out the window (we live in a large apartment building in an interesting part of a major US city)

I always loved seeing the absurd drama from time to time. I left Facebook and other social media (for the most part) a couple years ago for opposite reasons because most comment sections being straight up toxic. But on reddit it’s neatly sorted and picked to a certain extent depending on what sub you’re in.

Of course I could go to other subs for certain reddit drama but the real chismes you just encounter in the wild. 

That’s it really. I guess there’s always Apollo still.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jk5e0u/i_regret_updating_reddit_because_i_cant_sort/,:chat: Just Chatting,55.17

The television played a Marilyn Manson music video. I don't remember the channel, or even the song.... Idc. And I'm also not describing what I saw in said music video for you right now. The memory is fuzzy, like a PowerPoint in my brain. Thank you, Marilyn Manson, for your heroism by causing a visceral mental blockage that altered the course of my life to find Mayo disgusting.

Thank you, Marilyn Manson.... Thank you for time-trolling 4 year old me and remain the only memory PowerPoint I have saved into my head of that age.

The man ruined mayo for me forever. Some good jams tho, even if he did time troll me.

If they lost their expensive sunglasses and they were broke, they'd rather just wait to get back on their feet with money and buy a EUR 150 Rayban rather than buying a good quality, stylish EUR 25 pair of sunglasses. I feel like I was duped into buying expensive ones for years because it is expected that you would do so, but then I just one day stopped doing it and started buying more reasonably priced sunglasses (like EUR 20-40 on average) and I was happy with the new ones I started buying. The variety was better and I had more choice when it came to sunglasses. I started having 3 different ones at a time for different situations, whereas before I would just afford the one pair and use that for everything. I guarantee you that if I showed you my expensive sunglasses and the cheaper ones I bought and the brand was hidden, you wouldn't be able to guess which ones are expensive and which are not unless you're really into sunglasses probably.

I recently fell sick (I'll spare you the gory details) and received so many wishes of a quick recovery from my friends and acquaintances and it just feels good to know I was missed. I've always had trouble making friends and keeping them so it was really heartwarming seeing all the love. Over the years I've worked to heal and get better at social interactions so I guess this is a good report( ha!) on my progress. 

Just wanted to share this and let anyone who's struggling with making friends know that it does get better! You'll find 'your people' someday. And they'll notice your absence and make you feel loved!

I've been depressed and insecure for some time but I finally kicked the depression in the balls and started self improvement.

One of my current goals is to make a friend group like one I had in middle school ( fondest years)

I've already made a negative impression on everyone at my high school by being anti social and hiding in the bathroom during lunch.

I don't exactly want to be friends with everyone but just 3  close friends who I can fall back on.

Btw, I already have few friends but from different groups and each have different interests from each other.

When I was in grade and middle school I had crippling social anxiety that made me physically ill to do things like five a presentation. I hated being so introverted. So scared of everyone. I’m like 7th grade I went to therapy for it and I think I’ve finally reached a point that I’m happy at. I’m 18 in college now so it took all of high school but I’m actually bold. I can talk to an employee in a store and ask where something is without breaking down. The reason why I was thinking about all this is cause I recently contacted someone I knew in middle school on Instagram since she’s still in my city. My mom was telling me how she’s been so bored since she couldn’t go to school cause of Covid. She hasn’t responded but tbh. I’m ok with whatever she says because I’m just so baffled that it took me less then like ten minutes to decide to shoot her a message saying that if she ever wanted to hang out. That’s something I didn’t think I would ever be able to do. I just wanted to talk about it for a bit. I don’t get to brag often about this kinda thing so I thought I’d just share. I know a lot of people on reddit have similar anxieties to what I used to have everyday. Just wanted to show that getting help is life changing and you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for it. And to not think it won’t work because you haven’t seen progress in a while. It took me 5 years to realize that it’s ok to want to do something like change how I dress because I was so afraid of how my family would portray me. People grow at there own pace. Anyway thanks for reading if ya did. If anyone wants to share their little things they did that they’re proud of, go ahead.

Most of the times that I go I use Spanish bc...well why not. So the most recent visit, was finishing working for the day and went across the street. The main cashier was already helping  a mom and her daughter. As they're talking I'm checking what empanadas they have leftover. 

So as the mom was finishing up her order the cashier looks to me and asks which ones I'd like. 

So I'm like ""dos jamón y queso porfa""

But ig the mom had wanted those two or some other flavor beforehand. So she's telling the cashier that its fine or whatever (I didn't pick up on their convo bc my mind was focused solely on one thing and it was those empanadas haha). 

So the cashier starts bagging them up and, to the mom, I'm like ""estás segura?"" and she just kinda turns around to look at me (I'm Black btw) and then looks at the cashier, and she's like ""¿él hablaa español!"" and the cashier is all piping me up like ""Siiii!"" and then I'm just standing there blushing feeling all awkward and shy like ""Noooo, solo un poquitito"" (even though I know full well I do lmao)

My roommates last semester (before Covid hit) were pretty bad, so I spent most of my time in my room to avoid them, or at least that's what I thought. I'm now realizing I have pretty bad social anxiety, to the point where I'm scared to leave my room even though my roommates now are very nice.

I just need to know what the expectations are. I can order food and go to school and work and things like that because I know what's expected of me. It's like a list of rules in my head. If I know the rules I can follow them and do okay. Like I can hold a friendly conversation but it never gets farther than that. It's also kind of how I feel emotions, if that helps you understand my situation. I know what's expected where and act accordingly. I've just never created a list for making friends, so I just kind of shut down whenever the opportunity arises.

Another issue i have is doing favors for people which usually would be paid commissions, because i just don't have the heart to tell them that ''hey, we're good acquaintances, but i don't want to waste my time for free.'' Or ANOTHER issue is asking for money back or standing up to people not making good on deals - i usually just say its fine and move on...

I cried at an empty lunch table on my lunch, facing the window so no one would see me. A friend I made outside work (who coincidentally works at the same building as me) sat at my table and talked with me, she helped me relieve some of the guilt I have on myself and talked about her own experiences from when she first started.

While I'm still sad its made me really grateful for the friends I have, I may be new and still learning but I'll someday learn everything I need to know and be able to help the next person after me, hopefully making their time a little easier.

I love to draw and paint so I really want to get more into makeup. Right now I really only use L’Oréal, Elf, Covergirl, and occasionally other drugstore brands. I usually wear eyeshadow, (in a natural/rosy tone) mascara, winged eyeliner, and foundation/concealer. I’ve never used a high end or fancy makeup brand, except for one small MAC eyeshadow palette.

I follow Maddie Ziegler on Instagram and she posted saying there’s a sale on her Morphe palette for her birthday. I checked it out and it would cost me around $30. The colours look really pigmented and I would use a lot of the more natural tones daily. I’ve been wanting to experiment with more colours, especially for things like Halloween so those would probably be put to use too.

I would say I’m a fan of hers, but I don’t want to be influenced into buying it just because of that. I also just got my wisdom teeth out and am in a lot of pain so I’m looking to cheer myself up lol!

I am a Sophomore in college, I worked full time over the summer, and have been working as a part time intern since classes started up. My college requires every student to complete a professional experience before graduation. Most don't complete theirs until junior year.

Some of the things I've realized since being told that I lost my job:
- It's 10 more hours I get to use towards school and/or relaxation as finals near
- I wasn't let go because of my personal work performance, it was on the company's end.
- I worked very hard for over 5 months, and I am proud of my work.
- I am ahead of the game in many senses 
- I have more freedom when I return home for Winter break.
- I have been held in high regard by all of my colleagues for the duration of my time with the company. 
- I will have some awesome recommendation letters for when I apply for another job.
- I have built a larger network.

There are more I can list, and all of them are good things in my eyes. How can I be sad when I did the best work I could with the time I had with the company. Rather than being sad, I'd rather celebrate my accomplishments because in 5 months, I achieved a lot!

Guys. I used to be one of those people who didn’t like doing much, just staying in bed most of the time and not leaving my house. This is month 7 of our lockdown and I’ve done a 180. For all you hermits out there you need to do something that involves moving. Dance, walk, workout, anything. Don’t sit on a chair and lie on a bed all day. 

I always knew people kept saying sedentary lifestyles were bad for you, but I never realized it was this horribly noticeably bad. At the beginning of lockdown I was a healthy college girl. That’s all. 

Now I currently have:

Chronic fatigue syndrome (likely from not moving, monotony, and online classes) 

Worse vision (screens all day every day)

Venous insufficiency (seriously my legs hurt in the morning because of blood pooled in legs) 

GI problems (indigestion in general)

Stiff muscles 

And back pain. Not the regular kind, just bad back pain

And all of this got better once I started moving. 

I DID see a doctor, and everything is fine with me. Except not moving, and stress. I did the bad thing where you have no exercise whatsoever and then also become hyper long term stressed. It made my muscles unusable, and gave me tremors. I don’t think I’ve fixed my breathing yet either. 

Tell me about how lockdown as affected your health! And once again, MOVE AROUND DO NOT LIE ON YOUR BED ALL DAY. What do you guys do, especially those with online school/ college/ all day stuff to stay healthy?

He made me fall in love with cats. He’s so good and pretty and silly. He’s feisty sometimes and he has a really cute unique meow.

I had a conversation with a resident there:

him: ""hey, if you have alzheimers, would you know?""

Me: ""well, at some point i suppose you wouldn't.""

Him: ""I have Alzheimers. Thats why im here.""

Me: ""Dang 💀""

Him: ""I mean, there wouldn't be any other reason, right?""

Me: ""Gosh, I wouldnt know, I'm just a housekeeper.""

Him: ""Oh I love philosphy!""

Me: ""yeah?? 😀""

Me: ""Oh, at university?""

We lost contact a bit after high school but reunited a couple years after that. Like I said we had similar hobbies and would do them together like go to races, play fantasy football, video games and stuff. “Johnny” however has always been a bit immature and has this “me against the world” and “my way or no way” attitude. He has had some issues with a few other people in my friend group as well and when there was a time when another friend of mine and I were having a disagreement, I feel like “Johnny” influenced my decision too much about how I was disagreeing  if with the other friend. Fast forward to last week, in our fantasy football league, I thought I caught “Johnny” for cheating. Turns out he wasn’t and  on Friday, I apologized and admitted I made a mistake. He never replied to me and left me on read. Then yesterday, when I was talking with another friend on a Facebook post, Johnny comes and and starts verbally attacking my saying I’m garbage and what not. So I blocked him. Blocked his number on my phone and he also unfollowed me on all social media before I even had a chance to do so. 10 years of knowing someone and some nasty colors starting coming out from his personality, all because I thought he was cheating and acting on concerns from other friends. It feels odd knowing he almost no way of contacting me because he’s been in my life for 10 years. But at the same time, I feel like I got out a break up of a bad relationship.

He and I were in different classes so I didn't met him until the contest. We mostly made small talk and stuff before talking about our fandoms. We did stoopid stuff sometimes and it was fun. He was my first actual friend at the school lol.  


We were teammates again at the next round of the contest but the pandemic cancelled it. Which was disappointing since I only knew him for like 3-4 months. School was still ongoing so we still sometimes  talked during recess. I think our last real conversation was about a manga app haha. He doesn't have any social media so I can't really talk to him during any other time. Although I found a Facebook acc in his name made the day before our online classes started. It was privated so only thing I could do was friend request him. His dms were off so I couldn't really say hi. I just hope it's actually him on the acc and not his mom.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jasrux/i_miss_my_friend/,:chat: Just Chatting,83.76

j4mjyh,Tired after 8 hours of work,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4mjyh/tired_after_8_hours_of_work/,CptGiorgis,1,2020-10-03 20:53,"I'm 20 yo (M). This summer I worked at construction for almost 2 months. The job was quite tiring and paying wasn't good at all. I knew this would be only for summer since this is the holiday period of my Academy. Last week I started working at my father's taxi. I did it now because, the schedule can be quite flexible and can be changed according to my academy's lessons. At both of those jobs, I was occupied (and still occupied) for 8 hrs per day, 6 days per week. After my shift I feel tired and I don't really want to do much or talk to anyone. 

The thing that puts me into thoughts is that I'm only 20 and I can't be that easily tired. It's only 8 hours. Many people older than me work for more.

It's not that I'm lazy or something. I love working and I have this bad feeling when I don't work for over a day. You know that feeling. 

Is something wrong with me? Does anyone feel the same?

PS: The academy I'm studying at is a Merchant Marine Academy. Last year I spent 6 months onboard and I never felt as tired as I feel now. My daily schedule was 12 for 6 days and 8 hours for Sunday (I had watches, etc). The difference here is that I was really loving that job and I can't wait to go back once I graduate.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4mjyh/tired_after_8_hours_of_work/,:chat: Just Chatting,84.47

Actually, it was more of a demand by my bio mother. If a grade in a class or assignment was lower than 95% then to her I failed. When my parents divorced and I dropped contact with her I still maintained the idea of having the best grades as I can, because I felt like I had to compete with other students to prove my worth in salt, as well as believing that it will translate into life success. 

It hasn’t. 

What happened instead was I got really burned out. Classes became less and less interesting and I dreaded it more and more. 

I graduated with honors with my associates degree and was working on a bachelors in computer science until last year when I stopped. I don’t want to take anymore classes at all because i’m just absolutely sick and tired of it all. I’m absolutely discouraged to continue. And it’s my fault. 

Looking back, I could have placed more effort elsewhere than focusing solely on having the best performance in college. Like stronger friendship bonds, making beneficial connections, or learning new skills on the side. Or putting effort in the gym when it was free and when I had the resources. Because in the end of the day, someone who’s in the top 5 and someone who’s in the middle or so gets the same overpriced piece of paper. Guess I learned that the hard way.

Today was the first day I’ve cried tears of joy.

This post won’t be too long but I’ve come to an epiphany of sorts. (EDIT: It turned into a kinda long post. Lol)

I’m in my late twenties, no kids, just me and my dog. After failed relationships, two failed engagements, and a couple moves across the country, I almost lost hope and became jaded that I could ever feel this way. That I could ever truly find a life partner, a deep love, the most meaningful and almost... spiritual connection that you could ever imagine. (I blame Disney, lol.)

Today, after my boyfriend (of a few months but we’ve known each other for a year and a half) left home to go back to work after his lunch break, I literally cried tears of joy and happiness. 

I realized something... this is the FIRST time someone has made me or maybe EVER in my life that I’ve cried HAPPY tears, instead of all of the oceans and oceans of sad and painful tears I’ve cried for other men. I’ve NEVER ever been in a relationship like this before, nor felt this way before. Was losing faith that it even existed. 

I won’t get into all the gross lovey dovey stuff unless you guys want me to, there’s a lot of that too of course, but as far as RELATIONSHIP ADVICE goes: Wait until someone makes you cry tears of HAPPINESS. It’s truly a special feeling. 

So don’t give up... Who knows, maybe the third (or 5th or 10th) time’s the charm? xx

EDIT: You guys wanted the lovey dovey stuff so here it goes. Keep in mind this crap used to make me gag especially after being hurt so many times before.
- Here’s one: I moved back to Cali from the east coast of the US. He’s a big beer fanatic, like craft beers and IPAs and such. I’m not so much, but I did tell him there’s a beer from New England called Shipyard pumpkinhead that I loved and missed so much esp around fall, and I can never find it here. About a month later he had it at his house waiting for me. He searched high and low and finally found a 6 pack for me. When I tasted it, it tasted like home so much, I almost (okay I did) start to cry. Lol
- Everyday he tells me how much he appreciates me. EVERY. Day. Even if it’s just for making the bed or doing the dishes. 
- Every morning before he leaves for work (way to early for me to function idk how he does it), he kisses me goodbye all over, and says “here’s one so you don’t forget at 10am, here’s one for when you forget at work, here’s one for... etc etc.” 
- I recently started my own business and he’s a graphic designer, so he’s hand making me all of the business cards and graphic pages, etc. He pays attention to everything I say and love, so he incorporated Tiffany blue into my cards and pages, knowing that my favorite movie is Breakfast at Tiffany’s...
- He’s made me believe again in a higher... purpose? Power? I’ve always felt it existed still but he’s a “true believer” you could say. It is a good feeling there’s something out there guiding us sometimes... or that everything happens for a reason.

I had a normal dream. I was walking to the bus somewhere and suddenly I saw my mother! She wasn’t alone tho. When I looked around, I saw that she had a dog with her. That dog looked exactly like our dog did. 
I went to say hi and she told me that his name is „Tommy 2“. At this point I just started crying. Not only in my dream but in real life.

You have to know that Tommy, was my dog until a few months ago. He had to be put down because of his age. Even just writing this makes me cry again..

I noticed my bf tried to wake me because I cried a bit already. After I woke up a bit, I realized that it was a dream but i still couldn’t stop crying about it.
That’s the reason I’m writing about it now, in hopes that I can move on someday.

After he had practice doing tasks, killing, venting and sabotaging on The Skeld, I gave him a few extra tips for both playing as crew or impostor and he was ready to play online multiplayer. 

He's not a person who plays these kinda games (or puts much time into playing *any* videogame), but after a few minutes playing it, he loved it. He didn't become the impostor once, but he loved it. The drama that happened during meetings and the seeing who got voted and if they were impostor or not was one of the things, especially as cremate, that really hyped him up.

It was 11pm and he straight up played for 1 hour in bed occasionally informing me on the drama in meetings—people blaming him, who he thinks is the impostor and the results from voting. I cannot stress how much he enjoyed playing AU. After a while a got my phone out and joined him in a game, and explained the no-talking-in-person rule, and what counted as ""cheating"". I gave up after a while cause my phone kept lagging, but he played on nonetheless.

Here are some of his quotes:
- ""I feel like I could play this all night""
- ""Honestly, I'm gonna play this in school on Monday""
- ""After exams, I'm gonna tell Ezekiel (one of our friends) and we're playing, I swear I'm gonna kill him if I become impostor""

j5izl4,My broken phone taught me life lessons,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j5izl4/my_broken_phone_taught_me_life_lessons/,Unknown_ideas,4,2020-10-05 13:03,"  For most of my internet activities I have always used a computer (desktop). Often when I come across articles, videos, studies, hearing others talk about how many people became addictive to smart phones—mostly about teenagers, currently I’m 18 btw—I never fully understood that, because I didn’t own one. How come people cannot control the time they spent on phones as well as using it always and let it distract them from enjoyable moments along with responsibilities? Until I owned one 2 years ago.

It was a relatively old phone of my dad; however it had a broken camera along with poor energy storage as it does not last for more than 1h30min before suddenly it shuts-down (remember this). Well it was a bit disappointing as you would imagine for a teenager to get that, nevertheless I went with it. 

Then I truly understood what was being said before about smart phones, they are so addictive! It truly takes some decent amount of self-discipline—which many teens lack that in my opinion—then I started noticing things. The computer does not send you notifications, further more you don’t take the computer with you everywhere, connecting to social media via phones it far easier and has less steps than computers! As a consequence you do not get distracted by it *everywhere* (i.e. computer) and enjoy the things outside from such as the wind blowing or sitting in a garden to studying or at dinner table. 

I started noticing the tremendous effects of social media when connecting via phones on people—mainly teens—It was scary to know the impact of Instagram on self esteem, anxiety, time, the faking of almost everything from people’s looks and bodies to *sharing the happy moments only in a very selective way!* That makes you think that the people there are so happy and successful and compare yourself to them—continuously or subconsciously—(comparing reality to non-reality) as well as the other mental health effects; there is even a suicide risk! After many observations on my friends and people I know as well as my family—and myself--along with reading the studies about it I came to the conclusion that “**Instagram is platform where people share what life they want to live rather than the one they already live**” You should not even be sharing life online anyway, and I'm talking about instagram as one example. I also started taking the *massive* data collection that Facebook does and the almost non-existent privacy there more seriously, also the *immense polarization of society* that Facebook and other social media platforms—including Reddit--result in.  What also helped in the fact that I don’t have that many actual friends; I just don’t bother posting pictures or commenting, tagging, stories …etc

**Then here comes my phone**. Recall the 2 features of it—1h30min usage and broken camera--this really proved to be useful! With that camera broken I cannot take pictures (of videos) and instead *enjoy the moment and live it in the full sense*! I know this might sound cliché but it really is the truth, you don’t even think of taking pictures to share them on social media or take stories to show you are having a fun time. The 1h30min usage is such a great way to manage time, often I get into the YouTube rabbit hole or scrolling into an endless feed instead of studying or doing better activities then *suddenly* the phone shuts down. Now I have to do whatever I needed to do! That is useful than wasting time. 

Not only had I got a phone at a decent age (16) to think rationally about these sorts of the things but also a phone that is more like a mentor! I learned from it time management, self discipline, and actually living rather than spending hours watching videos or scrolling a never ending feed while letting my responsibilities. It is a huge danger for a teenager less than 15 years old to get a phone, I feel I am saved!

Last Friday we decided to start trying for our first kid next February, which gives me a few months to get back into shape, get my PCOS under control, and gives us time to move into a bigger apartment (our current one doesn't even have a living room, lol). I'm hoping to get pregnant naturally so I don't have to go through expensive fertility treatments. We took a walk through Target's baby section over the weekend for a ""reality check"" on our decision and it was actually enjoyable. I think we're just about ready to start our little family. 

We bought a new cat tree for our two cats over the weekend, too. I woke up in the middle of the night hearing them playing together on it. A normal person might get annoyed by this, but they're really good boys and I was afraid they wouldn't take to the cat tree. Thankfully they really seem to enjoy it. Well worth the money spent! 

The weather is changing into fall and it's so enjoyable outside. I think we're going to have an early winter. I wish we had a house with a screen porch so we could sit outside sipping coffee or tea and enjoy the weather. One day we'll get a house, but that might mean moving back to my home state, where houses are significantly cheaper. Of course that'll mean both of us will have to hunt for work there and I just don't feel ready for that!

My current job is pretty low stress (office work). So long as I can get all of my tasks done in a timely manner, I can read, reddit, do homework, etc (still working on my associate's degree; one more semester to go!). It's a small company and my boss is trying to go part-time (and eventually retire). I don't feel totally comfortable replacing her, but that's because I prefer taking direction over having to make tough decisions. But maybe this will be a growing thing for me, who knows? 

My health was a mess in August-September but I finally feel like I'm on the mend. My mother in law commented yesterday that I look happy... and I AM happy! Which is a big deal for someone who deals with clinical depression. 

So yeah, things are going well and I hope that they will continue to go well.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j9t8ii/just_so_happy/,:chat: Just Chatting,79.5

Allow me to introduce myself, I'm an 18F first-year uni student. I am currently taking a month of mandatory military training in a base far from home, far from pretty much everyone I know. 

A story on my relationship with my boyfriend, and some darker things:

We met, chatted on class halls and came to like each other, started the relationship after 3 weeks in. Throughout the relationship, I have noticed many, many major red flags, some I called out on him, some I looked over. Turns out things were darker than it should be. 

Even though I had seen those red flags 4 months into the relationship, I have given him chances and chances. He might have taken it for granted that I will accept a busybody, absentee like him. I don't. I have texted, messaged, called and wrote letters to him. No reply for the past 3 months. 

So I dug for the truth. 

There was a third person. That girl who I have enevr met face-to-face. She had known my bf for more than 5 years, and she is a really brilliant person, but mentally unstable. As far as I know, she is really manipulative but her behaviors didn't show until 2020 came. 

She planned to ""harvest"" my boyfriend as her play toy. I suspect, with hard proof and personal experience, that in those 5 years, she had tamed him to the point he not just adored, but worshipped her. My boyfriend always take her motto as his own. He points me to her for advices when he can't answer me. He mentioned her way too often in our conversations, until I asked him to reduce the mentioning to none. 

I was only a pawn for her to entertain my bf while she wait the time comes the harvest him. 

Poor him. But I have decided to leave. For the sake of my mental health, which had been worsening for the past 2 years. 

Then grief hit me like a truck. 

Denial - I have lost to manipulation and didn't want to believe it. 
Bargaining - I have had plans to attempt saving him out of manipulation. 
Depression - I saw no way out. Every single problem only leads to further problems and no solution with high chance of success. 

Leaving is the only easy way out. The least painful. 
So I left. One-sidedly.

The physical pain from griefing the 1 year 7 months relationship set in. 
We have made promises. Plans. 
But it's gone now. Once and for good. 

I don't know if it's acceptance that I am having. To be frank, having been self-educated on mental health and having clinical depression gave me an insight to how to combat these sad feelings. This relapse. 

So it should be fast, it should go away and pain me very little. 
Move on.

On mobile so formatting/spelling is likely shit.

So this is random but it recently occurred again, I googled it and recieved the sweet sweet vindication of being right all along. 

When I was a kid (maybe 7 or 8?) I would be laying in bed at night and suddenly it would feel like the room was massive and I was very very tiny. It's so hard to explain the sensation, but almost as though the room is expanding at an alarming rate and I'm lost in the cavernous space. Sometimes it was my bed that felt enormous as well/instead and closing my eyes would make it much worse. It legit kept me up at night and I would cry for my mom completely terrified. My poor mother had no idea how to help me and just chalked it up to an overactive imagination. 

Well it turns out it's called Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and my version is just one form of it, you can see other crazy shit if you have an episode too. I don't blame my parents because I sounded like a little kid having nightmares and I was having such a hard time explaining it. Your kid just says the room feels too big and you're gonna be like oooooooook...? 

Anyway I would love to hear if anyone has a similar experience with AIWS or even just stories of your parents not believing you where you were proven right in the end.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4uh58/bizarre_thing_my_parents_thought_i_was_making_up/,:story: Life Stories,76.76

The game is super forgiving in terms of quick saves, repeating important information, and providing guidance. I was able to get used to moving the camera manually and am getting used to what all the buttons do. Plus, the game is beautiful. I can see why there is a camera feature, I use it constantly. 

For a long time I stayed away from 'real' games because I was embarrassed at how bad I was and didn't feel I could get any better. (The gamer community scares me tbh) Now I feel like a door has been opened for me to enjoy games I never thought of before!

I've met so many people from corporate HR, several university career services counselors, and people with decades of experience in my field and all of them have had different preferences for resumes.

It seems like people have a very right or wrong attitude when it comes to down to it, but the qualities of that perfect resume aren't consistent. And that's fine! We all have our preferences, but it's never really discussed that it can be very subjective once you have all the important details on there. For example, someone has told me my resume is boring and I need a fancy template to spice it up. Another person told me that I need to keep it basic for when HR files through that first round of people.

It's a really small thing that I've noticed. I've landed a couple great internships and I just put that same resume on my university's job search website - it was rejected and I now need to meet with someone from career services (again). Admittedly, I don't know everything about job hunting or the best resume for HR to see, but wow there always seems like there's something wrong with my resume.

But this guy [26M] is so different from the rest... I don't know whether it's because he's my father figure's nephew, or is it because I like him a lot... I was always so confident in myself which made it so easy to talk to the guys I had a crush on before, but the moment I saw him and he made eye contact with me, I just... I don't know... I feel like everything is slowing down, as cheesy and puke-inducing as it sounds, then I realized that I've been looking at him for far too long and I look away. I geeked out to my friends who were with me at the time and one of them is ""nice enough"" to call him so that he would meet us, and when he finally approached us I FRIGGIN BOLTED out of there and hide in the corner near the bathroom, where I can see them, he saw me before I ran away though, which make it worse since I feel so, so embarrassed. He ended up talking to my friends while I'm hiding, and I guess he spotted me when I peeked at them from that corner and my friend called me.

Again, I've never, EVER, felt that way towards anyone else before. My heart LITERALLY THUMPED on my chest when I noped out of there, and my cheeks got so red, my friends couldn't stop teasing me about it on our way home.

Dang you, Alfred. This is so embarrassing to look back at.

jiywf8,An incident from childhood which still hurts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/jiywf8/an_incident_from_childhood_which_still_hurts/,LocalThotsInYourArea,23,2020-10-27 10:52,"I was 7 or 8. I remember I used to really enjoy arts and craft, and wanted to be an artist. But I didn't really have an outlet to express it. My mom was good at crafting too, so she used to do most of my school projects. I didn't mind because it got me grades and let me have more time to play.

One day I did a drawing of a girl in tshirt and skirt. A simple childish drawing but I was really proud of it. When I came back from school the next day, I saw that my drawing had changed. The skirt now had pleats and a belt, the tshirt had a flower on it, the eyes were detailed and the girl had pink blush. My mother came from behind me and said ""It looks perfect now, doesn't it? Say thank you."" I was furious. I got so mad that I tore the drawing into pieces, and cried for hours. I screamed at her saying that she ruined my drawing and that she never lets me do anything. Instead of apologising to me and consoling me, my mother got mad at me back. She didn't speak to me until I taped back the pieces of the drawing and pinned it to my wall. Dad made me apologise to her for breaking her heart. Nobody cared about what I felt. I was told that if I really hate the drawing, I should make another. I didn't draw anything for two weeks because I was scared my mom will try to fix it again.

I'm 20 now. I am an artist. No matter how much validation I get, every piece I make reminds me of that incident. I feel like no matter what I draw, it is never good enough. I'm terrible at accepting criticism and have an equally tough time at accepting compliments. If somebody criticises my drawing, I'll stop drawing and hide away for weeks until I have fully recovered. And if they compliment my hard work, I can't believe them and think they're just being kind.

I have never been happier. This is my first time not getting rejected after asking someone out. Granted, it's my second time asking someone out EVER. The first person I asked out was a guy in high school who gave me a ""Sorry, I'm straight."" We remained good friends in high school, but what's weird is that my love for him didn't seem as strong as my love for her... my sweet Geraldine.

I work at Amazon Fulfillment Center. Early in working there, I noticed this absolutely gorgeous woman there. Even though we wear masks, obscuring half of our faces, her beautiful eyes were all I needed to see for my heart to jump out and run to her. My heart was lost without an owner for such a long time, and I wanted to get it back... or agree to a fair trade in Geraldine exchanging hers for mine, but she took it.

I was so nervous when I saw her. My heart began to beat so swiftly even just laying my eyes on her in all of her beauty. I could feel the butterflies dancing in my stomach. Sweat ran down my face. I had to do something, but I didn't know how to approach her, so I made a plan to begin greeting her with a wave every passing chance I saw her.

On the first day I thought to do it, I was so nervous and chickened out of doing it. I felt like such an idiot. I regretted it, as I wanted to close the gap between Geraldine and I, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I was so nervous, and she was so beautiful. This was all on Wednesday, by the way.

So, on Thursday, I make a move, and actually wave at her! It was the first time doing it, and she responded with a rather unenthusastic lifting of her hand, but she responded nonetheless. I get an opportunity to wave at her for a 2nd time that day, and when I do it, she enthusiastically waves her hand back and forth and smiles! We were wearing masks, but the shape of her eyes, or more bluntly, the fact that her mask slipped down a little bit, exposing her beautiful lips, showed me a smile. I was so excited and lost in thoughts of love all day. I had a moment that flashed where all I saw in my head was marriage, kids, and growing old together. 

I continue my habit of waving at her, experiencing varied reactions. Sometimes, she seemed as uninterested as the first time. Others, she was as thrilled as the second time. Regardless, I never let any of her waves upset me. Just the fact that she did it made my day.

Fast forward to yesterday, Friday, and I finally work up the confidence to make a move beyond a mere greeting. I write ""Call me xoxo"" with a heart, my phone number, and my name on a piece of paper, I cut it to be small, and I put it in my backpack. On the next day which is Saturday, today, and the last day of our work week, I notice her work station and wave at her. Unfortunately, a manager put me on the other side of the whole damn building that day, but it didn't stop me from leaving that side at the end of my shift to give her the paper.

I walk to her station, feeling so incredibly nervous, and I say to myself ""This is gonna be the boldest move you've ever made in your life so far. Are you ready?"", to which I respond ""Yes, I am."". I walk all the way to her station, and I give her the phone number. I was so anxious as she read it. Then she looked at me and clearly smiled, as I saw through her mask. She points at my name on the paper and says ""Is this you?"". I responded ""Yes."", and after that point, I was so excited that I forgot what happened afterwards essentially. She put the phone number in her purse, and I left is all all I remember. Aside from the fact that I went back, realizing I forgot to ask her name. She showed me her badge and said ""My name is Geraldine."", and then I left, skipping and dancing gleefully (not in front of her, though) with joy and excitement.

Even at this very moment, I still feel the excitement. And now I wait for her to call me again. Granted, I must say I do have this crippling fear that she ripped up the paper after I left and only pretended to be nice, but I try to toss it aside and think positive. Regardless, I'm happy and I can't wait to talk to her this weekend. My sweet Geraldine.

Truth be told, I dont want to go back anyway. 

I have made it through a few rounds of interviews for one company and I finally got the answers to some of my questions, including the salary. I have listed a series of pros and cons, can you help me decide if this is a good opportunity? (Realistically, of course it is. In all honesty, anything is better than nothing at this point but I dont want to somehow shoot myself in the foot)

1) its a work from home job which is honestly so freaking bomb, I love that so much. 
2) the salary is about 6k less than my current job/ one I got laid off from
3) at my current job, I had to commute one hour each way at a minimum, but it was usually more like 1 hour fifteen. So, ill be saving 2 hours of my time daily- 10 hours weekly - 40 hours monthly. That is great. 

Umm okay I think I actually talked myself into proceeding with the interview. The thought of a lower salary fills me with so much anxiety but perhaps it can he negotiated and I think the positives would probably outweighs the negatives. What are your thoughts on this?

Also how is your work situation going since covid?",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jco4ex/i_got_a_job_interview_which_is_pretty_positive/,:question: Questions,74.53
ja3kq8,My lie,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ja3kq8/my_lie/,Schmitty_Little_Lamp,1,2020-10-13 1:06,"Today, I was lied completely about my past, and changed my entire existence when talking about myself.

About an hour ago from when I began writing this, I was going on a daily run like any other. I was doing my normal track surrounded by the cold of a midwest fall afternoon. It had rained earlier, so the dirt was muddy in quite a few areas. I just so happened to slip when I was about to enter the dirt portion of the trail. I fell, covering my knee with dirt, and drawing a little blood which I found upon inspection inside my house.

I stood back up and leaned against a fence at the entrance checking to see if I was all good to keep running. However, from a little down the trail, came a girl who seemed to be about 25-30. She was dreads, and sandy brown hair. As she was walking past, I decided to open up conversation, because I'm a very outgoing person. However, as I began to speak, I realized I was putting on an accent. Now, this isn't that wierd, because I've been watching a lot of STORROR lately, and I've been doing accents all my life. And yet, as I continued to talk, I just began to make up a past. 

Apparently, I had come over from the UK when I was twelve, and I had lived here ever since. I was taking an off year from college to make some money, and I had been planning to work at a movie theater, but then Covid ended that. At the end, she offered me her business card,  but I backed up, thinking about Covid and all that. Thinking on it now, I'm not sure if she was interested in me, or just felt bad for me, and yet I don't really care. 

I know this is going to sound wierd, but to become a completely different person was nearly euphoric.  It felt natural in a way that I have not felt in so long. My heart beat extremely quick, and yet I felt completely calm. I felt in my element, lying... I'm not sure if I should have written this out, because I'm still very conflicted on my feelings towards it, but I just had to tell it to someone.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/ja3kq8/my_lie/,:story: Life Stories,78.99

I am not watching cartoons, I am watching the greatest show ever, the Venture Bros!!

Ever since the official announcement that Adult Swim canceled this incredible show, all I can think about is how much I hope someone else (like HBO Max) picks it up. I send tweets and Facebook posts to express my desire for someone else to pick it up (and I never use those mediums otherwise). I’ve been buying the DVDs and books to show people will spend money in support. And I’ve been rewatching it non-stop to boost the viewings on Hulu. It’s just an added bonus that I get to feel love and happiness while watching it. I also cannot get enough of this magnificent show. 

So when my wife yells at me saying I’m wasting time watching cartoons I am actually doing my part to help the rest of the world see how great Venture Bros is. I hope and pray to the universe that someone, somewhere, picks Venture Bros up so the world gets what it deserves, more Venture Bros. An Adult Swim special would be okay but this beautiful show deserves at least 3 more seasons to tell it’s incredible story. There is no show as enthralling and captivating as Venture Bros and more seasons of it would make the world a better place. 

Oh, if you haven’t seen it before, please do yourself a favor and give it a try. If I didn’t mention it before, Venture Bros is the greatest show ever!!!",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jijj7j/its_not_a_cartoon_im_not_wasting_time_im_trying/,:film: Movies &amp; Shows,77.47

He follows me around, sleeps with me, and has never let me go to the bathroom alone. He's an only child, no kids or other pets, and he's spoiled rotten.

However over the last year now and then it's like a switch is flipped in him and he gets really aggressive for no perceived reason. He'll literally be curled up in bed with me sleeping while I read, wake up, walk over to me purring, and then just fucking tear into me like he wants to kill me. I watch his pupils get big and he laser focuses in on my hand or arm and just lunges at me biting really hard. Sometimes he gets too riled up playing and will scratch but this is different. This is like he's not my buddy anymore and is out for blood.

The vet says he's perfectly healthy. We've tried him on anxiety meds but it doesn't stop this behavior and they just make him groggy all day.

We have block system so this is my third class I've had with him (planning on taking at least one every semester). Anyway, because we have virtual school right now we can't exactly practice acting on a stage, so instead he gave us an assignment to make a short (around 30 seconds) scene every week for four weeks that all relate to each other, and at the end of October we will have a short film. Anyway, I presented my second scene this morning and because I love filmmaking I put a lot of effort into it and was very proud of the outcome. After seeing it he told me that if that's what I wanted to do for a career it was totally a possiblity. So obviously that made me happy because I love this teacher.

So you might be thinking that he's just saying that to be nice. (Honestly I thought about that but just decided to tell myself that I did well and he wasn't just trying to be nice). But then my mom texted me saying that he had sent her an email saying how amazing I did and that if this was my career goal that he supports me 200%. It made it so much more validating that he went out if his way to make sure that I knew I had done well, even though this was literally just a school project.

Anyway, that made me very happy and I'm now having a great day and wanted to share!

We were supposed to play at the end of March but covid closed our school 2 weeks before. We were all very very sad because we worked hard for nothing.
During the time where the school was closed our teacher on a video meeting told us that if we wanted to get everything back on the next school year we could possibly play in October. We accepted immediately we wanted to finish what we started !

Then comes September and back to school with masks and rules to stop contamination. But I was looking forward to play I wanted it ! Then I had a conversation with some of my friends from the group who told me they've lost their motivation that they don't want to play anymore. I was devastated the teacher was too. Our group lost half of his member (not enough new ones so now we're 8 compared to 17 last year). 

One week though a member from last year came, she said that she couldn't be joining the group this year but that she wanted to get the work from last year back. Our teacher said that we could try something but it would be a short version + we only had 2 days of rehearsal. That was challenging but we were ready. Both new and some of the old ones were motivated.

I’m fond of plenty of things, but something I really like is observing human connection.

The thing is, I’ve never had that. Ever. I’ve never even kissed someone. And I know that I’m young and have a life ahead of me. But once you reach a certain age and you haven’t experience anything like that (even in the most remote way), to accept that things aren’t going to change is pretty much the best option.

Recently I became aware of how I myself considered marrying before getting kids a total default and did not expect there to be super many children outside marriage. I was surprised that in Germany for example 35% of all children are born outside marriage!

That got me looking it up a bit more and apparently thankfully it does not make a huge difference here anymore, as you can sign some documents before the birth and you get all the same rights, except for if you split up, then it gets complicated.

What shocked me was that children born outside of marriage had less rights until 1998.

What are your thoughts on the matter? I have come around to believing having kids and marrying later is totally fine and not a big deal now.

I was mean to girls to get attention and I had a lot anger management issues. I was not a good guy and today I realised how much I have matured since then and I am so thankful. I have aspergers but I rarely tell people to avoid any issues but I am very self conscious of it. It has led to me being awkward and having horrible reactions and interactions. 

At the start of this year I had to text some girl I used to have a huge crush on years ago for a project. We are friends but not very close, like close enough to talk sometimes if we share a class. I got her number and I was texting her about the project  then we ended talking a lot more. Not for hours but every day we talk for a while and she offered to help me study. I accepted of course because I am struggling but I sat there and I was amazed by how I was handling this.

She is a very pretty girl. She is ""perfect"" involved in school, good grades, sports, etc. All the guys at school want her (I am not implying she was hitting on me in any way) and would kill to text her. I am not very popular. I am much more reserved. I was still floored by the fact she was talking to me and wanted to work together but I reacted much differently than I would have even a year ago.

There is this girl. I am absolutely in love with every aspect of her. I'll keep the background of our situation private but it is not very common. I didn't think it would last in any way but we talk every day for hours and we play video games and just talk. I love every second I spend with her. She is truly amazing,

If this situation would have happened a year ago I would have been a jerk and flirted with my old crush while trying to get with the new girl. I just sat there and I was stunned by how I was handling it and I am very very proud of myself for coming this far. I have respected my old crush and I have moved on past her but I still am open to this surprising new friendship. I have no interest in pursuing her because of this new girl. I know this may not sound like much to anyone else but it really means the world to me and i wanted to tell someone.

Even though I generally like technology and know basic coding, I didn't know enough about it to code a bunch of strategies. My teacher recommended I just do 5 or 6 strategies. After any bit of research, it becomes very obvious that 5 or 6 isn't enough. So, one weekend later with my dad (who knows how to code) and I learn the basics of coding in strategies. He made the basic engine, and all I had to do was put all of the strategy's conditions in.

After a few weeks of work in my free time, I had done about 20 strategies. At this point, I thought of maybe including some of the more technical strategies, but they looked too complicated for me so I decided not to. I got really stuck on one that looks easy but is actually hard, but yesterday I got unstuck!

I'm not talking about people who personally don't like modern rap. That's cool everyone has their preferences but I'm talking about people who actively go out of their way to complain about and hate on modern rap music. I've seen so many people call modern rap talentless and an extreme downgrade from rap from the 90's and music from that time period in general but I just don't think thats true. Music is meant to evolve and change over time and rap has done exactly that.

If you want real deep lyrical content thats meant to really make you think and try to comprehend what the artist is saying theres amazing lyrical rappers like j cole and kendrick lamar who have put out incredible records. If you want a song that you can vibe to at a party or in the car with your friends theres so much rap for that too. Not every song has to have some kind of deep lyrical meaning for you to be able to enjoy it without someone saying ""that takes no talent to make"".

Another criticism I see is how a lot of melodic rappers rely heavily on autotune which I also dont think is fair because these artists use autotune as its own instrument and a lot of these melodic rappers are actually decent singers as they've proven from live shows and things like that they just choose to use the autotune cus it fits the genre of music and they believe it sounds good. I get that that's personal preference but its not fair to denounce an artists talent because they use autotune and you're not used to that type of sound in music.

I also hear people talking about how all rappers nowadays sound the same and everyone with ""lil"" in their name makes the exact same music but if you actually listen to a lil uzi vert song, lil peep song, and a lil dicky song and genuinely think they sound anything like each other you need your hearing checked because these people are all vastly different in both their lyrical content and their musical content as a whole.

Even rappers like lil pump and tekashi 6ix9ine do actually have talent because while their music is probably fairly easy to make, they've managed to built an entire brand for themselves and monetize that incredibly well while keeping a easy to spot and widely known persona through the internet and even tho they're music itself might not necessarily take ""talent"", its catchy and a lot of people like listening to it so that's all that really matters at the end of the day.

One more criticism I hear is that modern rap artists don't write their own songs or create their own instrumentals. Saying rappers don't write their music is just flat out not true because they do, but the criticism of rappers not making their own beats isnt fair either. Most rappers work with a producer to find a beat that they want to use for their song and they have input over what they want it to sound like while the producer makes it. It's a collaborative process where the rapper does what he/she is best at which is rapping and the producer does what he/she is best at which is producing to come up with something that neither could've dont on their own.

There's probably other criticisms that I forgot to address but this is all I could think of and I get that modern rap music isn't for everyone, especially older people who aren't used to that whole sound in music, but I don't think it's fair to say that any kind of music is worse or takes less talent just because you don't personally find it appealing from the bits of it you hear on the radio or something",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j6bh11/modern_music_and_especially_hip_hop_music_gets_a/,:note: Music,57.17

I choose “Fast Car” by Tracy Chapman and I received comments such as having a weird taste in music. It’s funny because a few year later, Jonas Blue made a remix/cover on it and it became a trend...

Recently, “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac became a trend on Tiktok and just as Fast Car before it became a trend, I was called weird for liking it so. Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely happy that Fleetwood Mac is getting recognition for how awesome they are and no one should be selfish with music. It’s for all to hear.

Now I have to worry about something all the time instead of everyday, and I can only feel happiness once I stop thinking about anything at all.

And I can't make new friends either, because everyone seems way more interesting and smarter than me. I feel like I just can't fit in anymore. And everytime I start thinking about it I eventually start crying. And I don't think I should see a therapist because I'm afraid I would be just wasting their time with nosense, since I'm not even smart enough to have a mental illness.

I just want to chill, but I can't. Monday I have to worry about not looking weird at school, Tuesday I have football practice and it seems like everyone's judging me for being worse than them, Wednesday I have to go to an english school where I'm afraid that everybody there thinks I'm not interesting, Thursday I have to try to look smart at school so that I don't look dumb to others and on Friday I have football practice again, which makes me feel even more out of place since everyone's so much better. My only free days are Saturday and Sunday, and even then I have to worry about my grades, because if I don't study my ass off then I will definitely let my parents down.

Today, I had a Zoom workshop about ""Thriving in Challenging Times"" and it was given by a psychologist. 

At some point, she was covering the subject of engagement. By that, she meant the feeling of being so absorbed and immersed in your activity, that you loose track of time. It's the feeling you have when you're in the zone. She finished by asking us: When do we loose track of time (as in what activity gets us in the zone)?

All of the participants involved had to take some time to answer, because no one could really remember the last time it happened. Eventually, some people answered some things, but I straight up don't remember the last time this has happened to me.

I depend a lot on a schedule to reach my goals: time to workout, time to study, time to go to class, time to socialize, etc. Everyday, I do minimum: 1 meaningful thing, 1 beautiful thing, 1 good thing and 1 fun thing. With this, I'm able to work on my goals a little bit everyday without losing perspective.

However, this engagement question really has me questioning everything. Even if I have my schedule, discipline and motivation, I'm still not passionate enough to completely loose myself to my purpose. This can be said of any aspect in my life. I don't loose track of time when I socialize with my friends and family. I just notice ""Oh, I'm going overschedule. I'll have to compensate differently by cutting a different activity in my schedule"". I don't loose track when I workout. In fact, I even check the time to know how soon it'll finish. When I study, I'm not absorbed by my subject. I use the Pomodoro technic, because I know I can tough 25 minutes of something less fun until a break.

I'm explaining all this to basically ask the question in my title: When is the last time you lost track of time?",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jbswdk/when_is_the_last_time_you_lost_track_of_time/,NaN,72.56

During this whole *situation*, I've been kinda down. I haven't been able to pull myself out of this slump. 

The problem has been that I'm an introvert with some extrovert tendencies. I thrive in a social environment as long as it's not a daily, or even weekly, occurrence. 

I love the anonymity of packed dive bars. The people watching. The various conversations that I'm not pressured to be a part of. 

A great night is a casual conversation with someone I don't know and will likely never see again. Or, we become friendly and grab drinks together at some point in the future or even just run into each other again and have another meaningless but somehow also meaningful conversation. 

Between being laid off and locked in, I haven't had an outlet and started turning into a shut-in. 

But today, I went to the beach! No, I'm not hanging around a bunch of people. Yes, I'm wearing a mask and staying away from others. But I'm out. In the world. Enjoying the sunset. 

I get to watch people from afar and enjoy the beautiful day.

I’m more curious if weight gain has to do anything with psychology, what do you all think?;

I want to know what everyone's thoughts on the topic of weight gain, general wise, not just relationship wise in terms of an indication of overall happiness, or unhappiness.

For example, it's been said through studies that [people in relationships *tend* to gain weight](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/can-love-make-you-gain-weight) when they're *happy* in a relationship. Mainly for the sole fact that the individuals in the relationship do not have to attract anybody. So, they freely let themselves gain because there's no rules for themselves at this point thanks to security.

Then there is a study that [rich people tend to be more fit](https://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-exercise-every-day-2016-4) and workout more than people who aren't. Interestingly, it doesn't seem like rich couples gain weight, they tend to be most likely bein best shape. Which clashes with the above article on happiness.

Personally though, this does makes sense as far as relationship-wise goes, but outside of relationship wise, I think weight gain tends to be a subtle sign of hard times. Not flat out depression, but rather unhappiness as to why people stop caring about what they eat personally. Weight gain will always be a deep insecurity for majority of people, so it's strange to believe somebody is living life on cloud-9 when they're gaining weight when beforehand they were in an average healthy weight.

What do you think. Is the study far fetched? Do you think weight gain can a foreseeable indicator of somebodies overall happiness *ESPECIALLY* when it comes to a psychology reasoning.... *Or* is it something that means absolutely nothing with no psychological reasoning not in a relationship or in general?

Personally, my story - so I don’t know if I’m one of a low few but when I gained a lot of weight, I was overweight. It was mainly a sign of depression. I didn’t want to admit I was depressed, and emotional eating was me comforting myself. It got bad to the point where I couldn’t even walk up a flight of stairs and recognized myself. I lost it all though after putting myself in a better mindset. Working out also mentally helps me, strangely. That’s why I’m curious if absurd amount of weight gain / (even loss) can be a signs of unhappiness.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jgfk17/heavy_amount_of_weight_gain_indication_of/,:question: Questions,60.75

We used to go this popular pub regularly, we are three flatmates. This was before COVID-attack. One of my flatmates really liked the receptionist. He would spend hours flirting with her and she never resisted. Maybe she kinda liked it.
He tried getting her no. She didn’t give it. So we all discussed and out of brotherhood would go there, have one beer (because it’s odd to just go talk to the receptionist, the bouncers were pretty big), write our friend’s number on a tissue paper, give it to her and politely ask her to call him. He became depressed (due to other reasons) and won’t go. 
So eventually everybody no to go there. But I would go there, like daily, give her the number and come back. She understood I went there not for the drinks but for this.
Anyhow, this went on for months together. And then COVID happened. All pubs closed. We are all foreigners here as was she. But she stayed here.
After a week of lockdown, my friend got a message from random number, her, and they started talking.
Because of our fuc*ing (only k is * cause am pissed) job we don’t have a social life. He got busy and both won’t talk properly after few weeks and she got together with some other guy and posted on Facebook (yeah, my friend is in her friend list).
Today, my friend is going back home, like for good, so he invited her to our flat. We are in our rooms, locked ourselves, so he can talk to her in the living room.

I just went to get water from the kitchen and he was all emotional and crying, I think. He is bit emotional and like our younger brother, always making fun of people in a good way, keeping the group alive. I don’t feel good that he is crying for her.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jc7nqa/flatmate_crying_in_front_of_a_girlfor_that_same/,NaN,83.25

I'm writing a screenplay and I'm currently working on a scene that begins with a mechanic rolling out from under a car and getting into an argument with a client. The problem here is that I know jack shit about cars and will end up embarrassing myself  if I try to even try to pretend that I do. SO...I figured it wouldn't hurt to consult some people who might know a bit more than me. 

The mechanic is working under the car, and she discovers a really big problem that she tells the client about. The client gets pissed since he thinks he's being swindled, and he then gets in the car and books it out. Our mechanic is then left standing there, tools in hand, cursing the universe.

Things I would like to know:

1. What possible big problems could occur under a car.
2. What parts and tools would be needed to fix it.
3. How much it would cost to fix that problem",/r/CasualConversation/comments/j4y0t5/screenwriting_advice/,NaN,79.8
jgbp17,I'm 26 and thinking of going back to school after months of unemployment,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/jgbp17/im_26_and_thinking_of_going_back_to_school_after/,Sperabo,1,2020-10-22 23:54,"Hey guys, 

So I graduated with a BA in Economics last Spring; I had a full-time job as soon as I finished it, which I lost in July due to COVID. Finding another job has been a complete nightmare ever since; I live at home atm so I'm not in any financial strain but the psychological strain has been huge and as someone that loves working and doing things, this last month especially has been really heavy on my mental health.  


In fact, today my therapist told me that I may very well be in a state of severe depression right now (we had a couple of assessments together).   


So I was looking at some plan B's today and as someone that REALLY enjoys math, I figured ''fuck it'', I could go back to school and do math, and actually do something I enjoy for once. I have been thinking of a bachelor's in math+comp-sci that one of my local schools offer.   


I love maths, programming has been an interest of mine (I have a SAS certification and some basic knowledge of Python, R and SQL) so I figured that it could be a good idea.  


I want to talk to some people at the school tomorrow and see how much time it would take me to finish; I did some advanced math courses as electives before I finished my first BA like Cal 3, Analysis, Linear Algebra 1-2, and my Econ curriculum featured a handful of Stats courses.  


I'm also thinking that I will move out if I do end up going for a second degree; I will take some loans (Canada has a pretty nifty student loan system), and work part-time. Think this is going to be a huge shift in my life.  


What do you guys think? Is it too late for me to go back to school at 26? Is it going to be worth it? I'm very nervous right now, but I cannot stay miserable for any longer and I need a clear plan instead of (partially) relying on luck.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jgbp17/im_26_and_thinking_of_going_back_to_school_after/,:thinking: Thoughts &amp; Ideas,69.96

You know how sometime you listen to a song once and it immediatly shapes your taste in music for years to come or even life. Well that but in a deeper way, like it having a impact so strong on your psychy that you clearly feel there is a before and an after you finding this song.

It doesn't even need to have lyrics, some song just impact you on some weird emotionnal or intellectual level simply from their vibe. Which is qute fascinating because obviously if a song has lyrics it's way easier to put meaning to the feeling we have listening to them but song without them can touch us just as much because our brain just give it a meaning that we have to interpret for ouself.

Life is different now, yes. I'm married, and in my forties. I have kids. But I don't think those things are factors.

From high school into my 30s, I had a big, close-knit social circle. I stayed in touch with so many different clans: my theater friends, my neighborhood friends, my high school group (which was \*very\* tight even though everyone moved all over creation). Then, as we got older, it all sort of just...stopped.

My feeling is that social media got in the way, and also that people eventually just lose interest. I find the first one annoying, and the second one really disappointing. Also: why does everyone hate talking on the phone so much now?

I have never stopped being interested in people on a personal level. I do not use Facebook or Instagram because I don't like how impersonal they are. There's no interaction based on the information people post. I know I'm old fashioned. But I don't think that should be a big deal. I know it's incumbent upon me to be the one who calls people. Which is fine. But the conversations now are rushed, or people are doing dishes and banging around if they're not the one talking, or very brief because people just flat out don't like to talk now, I guess. They certainly don't make time to sit down and have a conversation. People don't listen, either. I've had people ask me the same question two or three times in the same conversation because their attention is clearly elsewhere.

I think often of my old friends. I wonder how they're doing, how their kids are turning out, what life is like where they ended up, if they're happy in their relationships. I know now that, mostly, other people don't think of these things they way I do. They're focused on life and paying bills and the stresses that come along with the pandemic. I certainly understand that...but I also am facing those same things. And I \*still\* think people are worth knowing about.

I have fantasies about starting a coffee shop where phones aren't allowed. I think it would have to be a private club to make that happen...but I'd be okay with that. I miss talking to people. And since lockdown started, I made that my project: just calling people, trying to say hello, offer support, just be a voice for other folks to talk to. Yes, I know there's not a ton to catch up on, but I don't feel like that should matter. 

I know these things are largely out of my control. I'm not looking for advice on how to connect with people. I've tried so many different things now (seeking pen pals, being a regular at a bar, working with other parents at my kid's school, kickball leagues, photography walks, etc.) I have largely given up. Thankfully, though, I'm not lonely. I have my wife and kids, and that helps a lot. But I do miss having friends outside the house, y'know? And I wish friends from past eras of my life didn't mind catching up every few months. 

\*\*Am I the only one who his starting to feel like the last human being on earth?\*\* Do any of you struggle with the same factors that I do? Do you miss talking to people with your voice as opposed to text and social media?

To be honest, I've always struggled to connect ""romantically"" with anyone. Platonically, not much of an issue. My sense of attraction seems a bit... unusual. Actually, I've looked it up, and I believe I may be demisexual, or at least have demisexual tendencies. For those unfamiliar with what that means, basically, I become attracted to people I feel a strong bond or attachment to.

I've only actually been attracted to two women in my entire life. The first was several years ago; there was a girl I worked with, and we worked together for a year or so before I realized I felt something for her. I fell pretty hard, I pursued it, got rejected, took it hard, made things awkward at work, and she kinda grew to dislike me quite a bit. I felt a tremendous amount of regret after that.

The second is a current thing I'm still dealing with. I've fallen pretty hard for the best and closest friend I've ever had, and we couldn't have dated before because she's been in a relationship the entire last few years I've known her, but she recently ended it, and I fell for her. I keep thinking about and wishing I could pursue it, but I really can't imagine she'd ever consider me, so I'm working on trying to suppress these feelings, because I really can't afford to push away my best friend like I did the last girl.

The thing that really scares me is that my family as a whole seems to have a very bad track record with relationships. Every family member that I know ended up with someone just for the sake of having someone instead of no one. There's no ""true love"" that I know of in my family. Even my parents have never loved each other, and are actually quite unhappy with each other. But they've all just ended up with someone because ""having someone is better than having no one"". And because of my dating struggles, and my demisexual tendencies, I fear this is the path I'm on, as well. Well, either that, or just ending up alone altogether.

I play around on dating apps, swiping and swiping, and all I feel is apathy. Even when I get a few sparse matches, the conversation just doesn't go anywhere. And offline, back when I used to have more opportunity to meet new people regularly, there's just never anything between me and another person to escalate to a more than acquaintance level. And now, I have no real opportunities to meet people regularly anymore, especially with the pandemic.

There's nothing that I want more

Than to see you smile again

You slip into darkness for

Months at a time and I'm a witness

Ooh darling don't you know I'll be waiting 

When you come around to the sun

Ooh darling I'll be there for you waiting

When all of the darkness is done

I wish I could take away 

all your pain and suffering

All I can do is be there 

When the rain is thundering

Ooh darling don't you know I'll be waiting

When you come around to the sun 

Ooh darling I'll be there for you waiting

jc6cw3,I don't understand why the straight-to-video Disney sequels are universally panned while the live-action Disney remakes are somewhat more accepted.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/jc6cw3/i_dont_understand_why_the_straighttovideo_disney/,hunter-da-hammah1,7,2020-10-16 8:44,"Not every single one of these movies is bad. Here's all the ones I enjoyed:

* Aladdin and the King of Thieves
* 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure
* Stitch! The Movie
* The Lion King 1 1/2
* Tarzan II
* Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch
* Bambi II
* Leroy &amp; Stitch
* Cinderella III: A Twist in Time

That's 9 good sequels. It's silly to say that these movies are the worst Disney projects ever, or should never be considered canon, or that they cheapened the Disney name. Yes, a lot of the sequels were cash grabs, but there were also a lot that were actually trying. Yes, they have a cheaper budget than their theatrical counterparts, but that's kind of a necessity considering they're straight-to-video. It's how well they stretch their budget that matters.

If anything, I'd say the live-action remakes are a lot more soulless. These are basically just lazy retellings of the original animated films, although always done with either a lot of flaws or with nothing added in that would make me wanna watch that over the animated version. The remakes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Mulan, and especially The Lion King are prime examples of this. The only two that even try to reinvent themselves into something new are Alice and Wonderland, and Maleficent, and even those aren't exact great.

With what is going on a lot of people do feel like they have this disconnect from the world &amp; believing they have no one there for support or comfort.. this should be seen as an opportunity to really self evaluate how you want to mold yourself for the upcoming future. 

Please take this time to slow down, pace yourself, learn your strengths and weaknesses, become one with yourself and learn how to give yourself support and comfort.

Strengthen your will, mind &amp; body.... Find balance before you seek peace, Learn your weaknesses before you seek strength, learn your enemies before you seek allies.

Because a day will come when you will have to go to war with your self (everyone does), &amp; it will be you and you only who will suffer the losses and accept the victories.. you will have to be the one who supports yourself and comfort yourself remember that...

Once you realize that, you'll realize that you were building yourself a bridge that connects you back to the world or universe this whole time..

New friends await when you seek self-love and not attention.

New families await when you realize loyalty makes you family not blood.

New journeys await once the traveller opens the wings to the next destination.

And 

A new chapter awaits when you're ready to flip the page..


I really hope this helps you and anyone else who might've needed to read or hear this, please discuss any of the battles you're currently going through,


 2020 was the year where I hit complete rock.

I learned even though you hit rock bottom you dig yourself deeper hole when you allow your emotions to take control of your thoughts and actions..

I learned to accept the losses for what they were and spread the ashes of the fallen battles towards a better a future..

I learned happiness doesn't come from fixing the past, doesn't come from the sun or moon, it comes from within.

I learned ego is a temporary solution to pride. 

And so much more but again I hope this helps. Love all y'all who ever you are.

we all walk and come from different paths of life, yet even during the darkest nights we as humans can find a way to help eachother create a beacon to guide us towards the path we were destined to walk.

Thank you for reading and or listening. 

Stay safe y'all, hug your parents if you got them, tell your significant other you love them, be honest and love yourself and never give up.",/r/CasualConversation/comments/jjyfj3/my_message_and_wisdom_the_world_needs_to_hear_i/,NaN,76.45

Comedy sketches are also sprinkled into each episode.

Main characters:

* Johnny - The leader of the group who picks up cases for them to solve and usually handles the negotiating. He takes his job very seriously and is always loyal to his team.
* Katie - The investigator of the group who carries the journal and magnifying glass and usually investigates and pieces together clues. She's a little more knowledgeable than the rest, and is a pretty gentle and sweet person.
* Bob - The brawns of the group who does the heavy grunt work and wrings confessions out of suspects. He's a little easier agitated, but will defend his team to the end.
* Hopper - Katie's stuffed bunny rabbit that she carries around. He can move and talk sentiently, but only Katie is aware of this, at least from the start. He also somewhat acts as Katie's conscience and voice of reason.

Structure:

* Act 1 (6 min) - Starts with the group doing something ordinary, someone comes to them with a case, they review the first bits of information they're given, and start their investigation.
* Sketch A (1 min) - Short comedy sketch that has some sort of connection to the episode's topic.
* \[Commercial Break\] (3 min)
* Act 2 (6 min) - The group is going around gathering information, finding clues, and interrogating suspects, trying to piece together all the ins and outs of this mystery.
* Sketch B (1 min)
* \[Commercial Break\] (3 min)
* Act 3 (6 min) - The group gathers together and adds up all the info they have, finds the perp, and sorts the whole mess out.
* Sketch C (1 min)
* \[Commercial Break\] (3 min)

Episode ideas:

* Books missing from the library
* Someone's favorite toy is wrecked/missing
* Hopper goes missing

I’m 27, the oldest of 3. My sister is 26 and my brother is 17. My parents have the most dysfunctional marriage. They are emotionally (and sometimes physically) abusive to each other. They fight dirty and would call each other the nastiest names. It has always been this way since as long as I can remember. My mom would constantly bad mouth my dad and his family. I remember asking her why not get a divorce at the age of 7. I used to think I would never get married because i thought all married couples act like that. I realized that wasn’t true and am now happily married.

My sister and I actually moved out of the country. My parents weren’t the only reason for us to do so, but they’re the biggest reason why we would never consider moving back. We’re from a culture where people work really hard to save face and divorce is basically a sin, so it’s out of the question. 

My little brother still lives at home because our home city has one of the most expensive cost of housing. It’s also normal for kids to live with their parents until they’re married in our culture. I feel so bad for him. He’s very distanced from my parents right now because they’re constantly fighting so he would just hide in my room most of the time. My parents got in another big fight last night and he sent me and my sister [this and said “me every time mom and dad fight”](https://imgur.com/a/A7Z3otL) lol

So I went on my usual walk around town with headphones on and in this particular episode the guest was Mark Sisson, on which I did my share of googling after and it turns out he is an admirable athlete in several disciplines.  


The basic premise  is that today's general nutritional recommendations are nowhere near the ones that we should be are made by nature to follow and that is the reason we are not as healthy or as strong as we are supposed to be. Now notice that he is not talking about an average diet of an average guy, but he is saying that the general healthy eating rules and tips are not even healthy, they are bad even! Now I understand he has his own diet plan he's trying to sell, but he didn't invent all of that paleo philosophy, and I also had my fair share of eating Keto (which is not the same, but is great nevertheless), so I'm pretty familiar and comfortable with the idea that not everything they say is all that healthy.  


Also he was talking about our typical association with proper exercise (get your heart pumping like 80% of maximum capacity for 30 minutes etc) in nowhere near what our exercise regimen should look like, because our ancestors never really did that. They had more of the lower impact movements, with occasional sprints (when running away or hunting), and there was never the issue of gaining weight because our body was accustomed to burning fat for energy so we weren't hungry as often as we are today, because carbs and sugars are causing insulin spikes which in return make us hungry more often. That's basically how I understand it.  


What do you guys think about all of this? Is there some unconventional nutritional tips that you have tried and it did wonders for you? Do you think that we should go back to our ancestral diets?

Defended and gave her a piece of my mind. Im bad at tldrs, just read it. Its not that long. \(×-×)/. I give up.

My bf and I are into gaming in our free time. My bf works as a counsellor and recently got a new job. My parents asked how hes been doing in his new work so I proceeded to update them about it. He works at a counseling firm that offers a broad range of specialties based on the counsellor's interests. My bf wanted to target the online community and most specifically, the gaming community. The firm he works at haven't started their online presence yet and were happy that he was showing interest about it.

He doesnt believe that gamers are addicted to gaming just bc they wanted to be. He believes that people uses it as an escape fron external factors or a substitute from face to face social interactions (baisically, a way to socialize). And, non of those reasons are inherently bad. We have online friends who we hang out on a daily basis that suffer from social anxiety, fear, depression, insomnia and worthlessness. Most of those emotions are caused by external factors that they can not contol bc not everyone is educated properly about social skills. So what do they do? They go into gaming to escape and to socialize almost anonymously. He understands what most gamers must feel bc he himself has been depressed, isolated and lonley and then proceeded to use gaming as an extension of himself.  Gaming kept him going. Gaming kept him alive.

My bfs, goal is to not get gamers out of gaming bc he loves gaming himself!  Games are essential to socializing, learning,competing and most importantly, unwinding in our modern age. Its a way to stay close to people who share the same interests as us. His goal is to help gamers develop skills to better themselves irl so they can game and live a healthy mental state at the same time and maybe better themselves in the long run. 

And this. This is what most boomers (like my parents) are ignorant about. I told my mom that ""just bc you do not know anything about it doesnt make it is wrong. Some gamers out their are suffering bc of things they can not control and then society ignorantly labels them as  ""video game addicts"". Bullshit!""

Moving on. For those that know the struggle, we all know the struggle of the pimples/blackheads on and around the nose. Firstly, they can be painful as all hell. Secondly, if you want to pop them you'll need the help of someone who mastered Instagram angles, because getting a good angle on popping those suckers is damn near impossible. Especially if they are smaller blackheads, like this sucker I have been fighting with for weeks.

I noticed him at the start of October, and all I could think was that, ""I know this is a blackhead"". It was at an impossible location, right under the left outer edge of my nose, and not only was it positioned perfectly to not pop, it was small as well. I tried and tried for days and would give up here and there, knowing I'm just squeezing my face at this point. Anyways, today marked the day I conquered blackhead. 

&amp;nbsp;

This particular experience was magical, as I had been working for weeks to get it, sometimes even questioning whether or not this was a facial feature and not a blackhead. BOY WAS I WRONG. I finally caught the angle on it, and squeezed. What released was pressure and satisfaction. This sumbitch was enormous and I feel fantastic getting it the hell off of my face!!

Now i trust Old Navy jeans because they’ve never done me wrong so since it’s getting cold i figured im gonna just grab one pair of jeans incase i start losing the weight miraculously.

He learned to like cats, and how to be around them without freaking them out, and how to play with them. He's curious about cats, but approaches them calmly, and if they don't react to him he loses interest. 

Jack Russells are small game hunting dogs with a VERY strong prey drive. If Diefenbaker sees something small and fast, he wants to chase it, even if he doesn't know what it is yet. He goes for squirrels, birds, snakes, frogs, leaves and garbage blowing in the wind, my phone when I throw it on the couch, you name it.

Sometimes on night walks, we see skunks. I've been so worried that he'd want to chase skunks and get sprayed, but.. . He doesn't. Diefenbaker seems to treat skunks like cats: he's mildly interested, and would like to approach, but if anything else is going on, that's the priority. The other night we passed within 15 feet of a skunk and he watched it but was much more interested in the blowing leaves.

It's almost enough to make me want to try letting him off his leash to go see the skunk... But no, not taking that risk.

“Maybe your liver isn’t metabolizing it properly”

for about the past two years, I’ve had some small concerns; “sub-par” bm’s, feeling tired after eating, having a hard time digesting certain things, tolerance for alcohol having gone down, occasionally waking up in the middle of the night with some discomfort in the stomach area... in short, a few super fun things

So anyways, I had an appointment with my doctor last week and the conversation left me with some concern... doc asked a few questions and tried to correlate a few possible symptoms I have; saying that liver problems sometime translate into the same issues I just mentioned about digesting and all

I’m having my blood test done on the 28th and I kinda anticipate some not-so-great news following it. Wouldn’t it be swell to learn I’m diabetic during the month for diabetes awareness?? I’m obviously hoping it not to be the case

In any case, I know I’ll be fine. Our healthcare system is good and whatever help I need, I know I’ll be able to get.

What scares me isn’t necessarily that I’m sick... What scares me is that I now have things in my life that I fear losing, by my own failing... a spouse I love, loving pets in good health, a career I’m proud of. I’m afraid that our common life now comes with a “but”

It’s the third night in a row that I get up at this time, stomach feeling iffy... my wonderful spouse has a light sleep so she often wakes when I do... and since she’s concerned for me, she follows me to the bathroom; even if only to sit across from me and reassure me...

I currently live with my parents. They're both retired, and have conditions that make them vulnerable to covid. We've been home for 7 months now. I haven't seen any of my friends in 7 months, the only time we do go out is if we need some groceries or have to go to the pharmacy and stuff. 
Most of the people around me have been socializing atleast a little bit since they lifted the lockdown in my country a few months ago, everyone has just accepted it as something we need to learn to live with. 
In the past 7 months, I've gotten into some fights with my parents, we have polar opposite views on some sensitive topics, that has been unpleasant but mostly it's been alright, we get along pretty well. 
Now, I've been yearning to go out. Not seeing anyone has really taken a toll on my mental health, I can't get myself to finish the smallest of tasks, I've lost all sense of motivation, I find myself crying very often and I just want to fucking go out and see some people but I feel extremely guilty.

So first things first, what prompted me to go get tested, simply put I started to feel a bit run down with cold/flu like symptoms and decided to rule out Covid-19. 


Now fast forward to today, how am I feeling... Bloody awful. 

Let's break down my symptoms.

Everything and I mean everything aches, and my eyes sting (didn't know this was a thing).

Breathing isn't as comfortable as I'd like, if you try breathing into a pillow that would be about as close as it feels.

I've got one hell of a headache running across my forehead.

Temperature is through the roof (although I don't have a thermometer at hand)

And then there is the fatigue, who knew simply walking to the kitchen was tiring.


Given I live in Scotland I'm now to stay home for 10 days from the result (assuming symptoms go away). It's going to be a horrible experience but I happy I have my wife here to go through this together (she also tested positive).

We‘d been chatting for a little over 2 months now and met for the third time last weekend. Every second we spent felt magical. I felt that I got very emotionally attached early on and thought that it was a pretty bad thing since everything was still so uncertain. That feeling got fainter though the longer we talked. I’m a dreamy person and spent some time of my last few weeks imagining future things like spending holidays together, having a nice family and a lot of other little things. 

About half an hour ago I got an audio message. In short, it was something like ""The chemistry isn’t right, I don’t want to hurt you but I don’t see us as being a couple."" Told them that that’s okay and I’m glad they got it off their chest and better now than later, thanks for your honesty, yadda yadda....

If I weren’t in the office right now, I’m sure I would have cried enough to have a headache by now. I feel empty. I seek fault in myself although I know that’s not going to help. After work I’ll meet with a close friend who’s the only one that I kept up to date on that whole topic. Other than that I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how long it’s going to take for this wound to heal. I didn’t know there could be a hole this deep in my heart after just 2 months of chatting/going on 3 dates.

Before that, I did an internship as an IT specialist and the company was very unprofessional and impolite, so I didn't want to do my apprenticeship there. Because we are not very wealthy, a replacement had to be found quickly and I thought that, since I wanted to be a therapist and am interested in psychology, studying in this field would be the best way for my future.

I also realized that this decision was made far too quickly, and I'm only here because I needed a replacement and wanted to escape my old situation. 
I know that I wanted to be a therapist but I didn't think that decision through. I don't quite know how to tell my mother and I am afraid of disappointing her, like when I turned down the training.
But in my opinion it's better to quit now before the debt gets higher.

I've also had sleep paralysis, where I can't move and I'm dreaming that I'm in bed, unable to move.  


This was that, but pumped-up significantly. I just escaped a dream about laying on the edge of my bed, staring across the room at a pillow I needed to go get. But in the dream, I was so tired, so weak, and my eyelids so heavy that I couldn't do anything but close them and rest. (I wasn't that tired IRL.) I had a sequence of dreams back-to-back about how I was laying in bed, so tired, and begging myself in my mind to get up. That I was wasting valuable time, that I had things I needed to do. Eventually, I had a dream in which I managed to get up and approach the pillow against the wall, only to then suddenly be back in bed, *convinced* that I fell asleep mid-walk, grabbed the pillow, and sleep-walked back to bed where I collapsed. There was now another pillow on the other side of the room, and the one I had just grabbed was in my hand, my arm hanging over the edge with it. So I tried to repeat the process, but was again too tired to move.

Although the lines move decently fast prepare to be hot as a mf, and the clean the rides for 10 minutes at a time. I don’t know the exact time but it’s about 5 - 10 times a day. #2 I want to add taking a 5 and under kid to Disney is a recipe for disaster they don’t remember  any of it and most cry almost the whole time. Making your life miserable, I’ve seen it way to many times for being there for 3 days. #3 Restaurants inside the parks good luck finding a table to eat at since Covid they do half seating inside of restaurants. But the issue is they just keep serving ppl and keep serving ppl so at time you have ppl waiting next to your table while your eating with there food so when your done they can sit there vice versa. Whole place is a shit show right now I do not recommend going to Disney right now or any school break that your kids may have to many people there.

Let me add some context.
I wasn't exactly bullied, but I felt like I was on the edge of it, and the only reason I wasn't is because the ""cool kids"" chose another victim. It was pretty much just like in the movies: sometime I had to pay other people's food, share my homework, offer myself to take tests so other wouldn't have to and similar things.

The final day of the final year, as I was going to buy a sandwich to one of the ""cool kids"", a girl I barely talked to after all those high school years approached me and asked 

""Why did you let them treat you like this the whole time?""

To which I replied without hesitation nor thinking,

""Because it's the best way to be forgotten.""

But ever since I was younger the term “gay” has always followed me around!!

My mum has mental illness and something involving her past really hurt her.

When I was growing up she would always say to me “you better not turn out gay”.

In school if I didn’t want to play soccer and just wanted to hang out with my friend the kids would call us “gay”.

Even when I started working and was on a night out clubbing with random friends  a girl just came up and asked if I was “gay”!!

It’s getting to the point now where I’m getting anxiety every time I hear the word “gay” brought up!!

If someone mentions something about gay people or anything similar I get really anxious and go red faced .

The term seems to have followed me round my entire life without me ever being gay!!

I don’t know what to do about it as it seems ridiculous but is very much an ongoing thing.

I really do apologise if I’ve offended anyone with my post but would just like to vent somewhere.
